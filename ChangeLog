    functionality for changing the font styling and color changing
    frequency under GtkSourceView 2. Unfortunately, this requires making
    separate XML files for each combination.

    the user clicks "Use defaults".
    * tabskein.c: Changed the skein popup menu so that the Delete options are
    no longer grayed out when the node is in the current thread; instead an
    error message is shown explaining why it cannot be deleted.
    * tabskein.c: Made the skein layout and trim dialogs modal.
    * tabskein.c, skein.c, skein.h: Added trimming to the skein, but without

    5J39.
    * gnome-inform7.glade, prefs.h, prefs.c, configfile.c: Removed the

    * compile.c, spawn.h, spawn.c: Fixed a bug where the last few bits of
    output from spawned commands were not shoved down the pipe fast enough.
    * compile.c: Fixed a bug where an error message was not displayed in the
    Problems tab if the I6 compiler failed without printing one of the
    expected error messages.
    * gnome-inform7.glade: Added key shortcuts to the find dialog and the
    preferences dialog.
    * gnome-inform7.glade: Built the skein spacing dialog and the skein trim

Sat Nov 4 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * searchwindow.c: Added <pre> to the list of tags recongnized by the
    HTML decoder in the documentation search, otherwise the program would
    crash when searching the new changelogs.

Sat Nov 3 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * file.c: Fixed a bug where extensions that specified things like
    "(for Glulx only)" were read improperly. Thanks to Eric Forgeot for the
    bug report.
    * inspector.c: When you click on the project window, now the Headings
    inspector only refreshes if it was displaying headings from a different
    project than the one clicked. Thanks to Eric Forgeot for the bug report.

Fri Nov 2 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * tabskein.c, tabskein.h, story.c, story.h, inspector.c, appwindow.c:
    Continued porting the Skein.
    * gnome-inform7.glade, skein.c, skein.h, tabskein.c, tabskein.h,
    appwindow.c, inspector.c, prefs.c: Temporarily hid the Skein tab from
    view, because it's not ready for release yet. The Skein data object,
    of course, still exists. It is also still saved and loaded with the
    project.
    * data/Compilers/Makefile.am: The compiler binaries are now not
    included with the regular source packages. If the binaries are not in
    the proper directory, the user is given a warning and compiling stops.

    things to refer to public beta 5F63.

Sun Oct 28 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    Skein.

Wed Oct 3 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * appwindow.c, appwindow.h, appmenu.c, appmenu.h, apptoolbar.c,
    apptoolbar.h, callbacks.h, Makefile.am: Split the file for main window
    functions into three parts, as it was getting unmanageably big.
    * appwindow.c, appwindow.h, tabdocs.c, tabdocs.h, callbacks.h,
    Makefile.am: Added a file for functions having to do with the
    documentation tab.
    * tabgame.h, tabgame.c, tabsource.c, tabsource.h, appwindow.c,
    appwindow.h: Moved some callbacks having to do with the specific tabs

    searchwindow.c, tabskein.h, tabskein.c, appmenu.c, newdialog.c,
    tabindex.h, tabindex.c, tabsettings.h, tabsettings.c, appwindow.c,

    welcomedialog.c, inspector.h, inspector.c, html.c, main.c, tabsource.c,
    tabgame.h, tabgame.c: Refactored "struct story *" as "Story *". Don't
    know why I didn't do that in the first place.
    * extension.h, extension.c, searchwindow.c, appmenu.c, extwindow.c,
    newdialog.c, file.c, file.h, findreplace.h, findreplace.c: Same goes for
    "struct extension *" to "Extension *".

    appwindow.c, appwindow.h, inspector.c: Continued porting the Skein.
    * gnome-inform7.glade: Enabled the Skein inspector.
    * One year ago today was the release of version 0.1. Never thought this

Sun Sep 23 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * skein.c, skein.h, tabskein.c, tabskein.h, prefs.c, prefs.h, story.c:
    Continued porting the Skein.
    * datafile.c, datafile.h: Added a function to look up pixmaps in the
    application pixmap directory.
    * tabgame.c, tabgame.h: Added a function to tell whether the game is
    running in either pane.

Thu Sep 20 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * appwindow.c, appwindow.h, html.c: Did a few speed improvements in the
    functions for looking up notebooks.
    * html.c, html.h, appwindow.c, appwindow.h: Cutting, copying, and
    pasting now work more naturally: they work on whatever widget has the
    focus instead of just the source. Thanks to Eric Forgeot for the bug
    report.
    * welcomedialog.c: Fixed a dir separator.
    * tabskein.h, tabskein.c: Added files to deal with drawing the skein and
    catching events from it.

    drawing the skein.

Wed Sep 19 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * html.c: Fixed another bug in the HTML loading routine that caused the
    images in the error pages not to be found.
    * compile.c: It is now possible to release a file to a directory that is
    on a different mounted filesystem. The way the rename() function was
    implemented prevented this. Thanks to Eric Forgeot for the bug report.
    * searchwindow.c: Searching the documentation now works again. It was
    broken because the searching code recognized "<body>" tags whereas the
    new documentation contains "<body bgcolor="bla bla">". Also implemented
    searching the recipe book. Thanks to Eric Forgeot for the bug report.
    * gnome-inform7.glade: Added Windows/Show Tabs/Skein menu item.

Tue Sep 18 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * html.c: Fixed a bug in the HTML loading routine that caused the
    program to try to load files outside of the Inform protocol with
    "file://" still in front. Thanks to Eric Forgeot and Artis Rosentāls
    for the bug reports.
    * skein.c, skein.h: Started implementing skein layout.

Fri Sep 14 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * file.c, skein.c, skein.h: Continued implementing skein loading and
    saving. Now modifying the skein (except for the 'played' status of the
    nodes) counts as changing the project (as to asking whether the user
    wants to save their project).
    * file.c: Added an assertion somewhere.

Wed Sep 12 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * file.c, skein.h, skein.c: Started implementing skein loading and
    saving.

Tue Sep 11 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

Mon Sep 10 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * skein.h, skein.c: Continued porting the Skein.

Sun Sep 9 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * configfile.c: Changed the mechanism for setting default values, so
    problems like assuming the slider position is 0 shouldn't happen again.
    * gtkterp/*: Added the capability to change the minimum size of the
    interpreter window, so now it can resize with the panel. Thanks to
    Nat Titman and Adam Davies for the bug reports.
    * gnome-inform7.glade: Fixed some misplaced HBoxes.
    * gnome-inform7.glade, tabgame.c, appwindow.c: The interpreter widget
    now automatically chooses the right number of columns for its size.
    * naturalinform.lang: Hopefully fixed the weirdness in highlighting the
    section headings.
    * skein.h, skein.c: Started work on the new Skein.

Sun Aug 26 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    Beta build 4X60.
    * compile.c: Removed reference to Error2.html.

Tue Aug 21 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * tabgame.c: Wrote a workaround for the bug where 'Replay' was losing
    the first character of each replay session.
    * skein.c: Now when getting a list of commands from the skein, they
    are newly-allocated strings instead of pointers to the skein strings, so
    they can be manipulated separately.
    * tabgame.c: Fixed a bug that made Replaying twice impossible.
    * Release 0.4

Sat Aug 18 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * gnome-inform7.glade: Changed the splash and about screens to display
    the version number as 4W37.
    * gtkterp/Makefile.am: Installed documentation in /usr/share/doc instead
    of /usr/doc.

Sun Aug 12 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * data/*, **/Makefile.am: Updated data files and makefiles for Public
    Beta build 4W37.
    * configure.in, tabgame.h: Fixed some spurious mentions of libvte.
    * configfile.c: Fixed a bug that caused the center slider to start all
    the way at the left when running for the first time on a system.
    * main.c, datafile.c: Stopped checking for the frotz binary at startup.

Sun Jul 29 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * appwindow.c: Changed the "Headings" menu so that it doesn't jump to a
    section heading when you hover over a menu item with a submenu.
    * history.c, html.c, appwindow.c: Now the "Back" and "Forward" buttons
    work with doc pages.
    * gnome-inform7.spec, data/Documentation/gnome/gnome.html: Prepared for
    releasing version 0.4.

Fri Jul 27 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    back and forward buttons for all the tabs and subtabs, but not for the
    doc pages yet.

    in the documentation tabs.
    * appwindow.c, gnome-inform7.glade: Implemented the "Headings" drop-down
    menus in the source tabs.
    * naturalinform.lang, inspector.c: Fixed a bug that recognized lines
    such as "Chapterwithoutaspace" as section headings. They shouldn't be.
    * tabsource.c: Changed the line number to an unsigned integer.

Thu Jul 26 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * appwindow.c, extwindow.c, configfile.c: Main and extension windows now
    restore the size and slider position of the last closed window.
    * appwindow.c, extwindow.c, file.c, welcomedialog.c: For users of GTK
    2.8 without GtkRecentManager, now the program can still open the last
    project from the splash screen like it did in version 0.1. The "Open
    Recent" menu item is not displayed anymore if not available.
    * colorscheme.c: If using a white-on-black theme, the section headings
    are not displayed black-on-black anymore.

Wed Jul 25 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * gnome-inform7.glade: Added mini-toolbars to each pane with back and
    forward buttons and other various buttons. To be implemented soon.

Mon Jul 23 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * src/gtkterp/*, configure.in, tabgame.c, story.c: Added embedded
    Gargoyle interpreters.
    * main.c, configfile.c, datafile.c: There is no need to check
    whether frotz supports the -w switch anymore.

Sat Jun 16 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * gnome-inform7.spec: Built new RPM packages for Fedora 7.
    * compile.c: Fixed a bug that made releasing an un-Blorbed story not
    work. Thanks to Evil Tabby Cat.
    * configfile.c: Made sure that the inspectors that have not yet been
    implemented are not set to display by default (this caused an empty
    "Skein" inspector to display on systems where the program was run for
    the first time)
    * gnome-inform7.glade: Changed the I6 compiling window to character
    wrap.
    * gnome-inform7.glade, welcomedialog.c: Made the font size in the
    splash screen absolute, so that systems with other default font sizes
    don't run the text into the image.
    * tabgame.c: Made a string constant out of the name of the frotz
    executable.
    * configure.in: Now compiles with either GtkHTML 3.8 or 3.14 API.

Tue Jun 5 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * appwindow.c, prefs.c: Fixed a bug that tried to open regular files in
    the Extensions directory as directories.

Sat Jun 2 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * compile.c: Fixed a bug that prevented the program from compiling on
    systems with both OSSP uuid and e2fsprogs uuid installed.
    * Release 0.3-2

Sun May 27 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * tabgame.c: Fixed the infamous bug that caused frotz not to find the
    story file. It was caused by trying to set the line width with the
    command line switch -w, which is not recognized by gargoyle frotz.
    * configfile.c, tabgame.c, main.c, datafile.c: Now the program checks at
    startup whether frotz accepts the -w switch, and passes it accordingly
    when running the game. This is so that people can use their own frotz
    binaries if they put them in their path.
    * file.c: Fixed a bug that prevented projects from being opened by the
    recent file manager when selected from outside of the program (i.e. the
    desktop's recent files list.)
    * file.c: Now the last project to be saved or opened, instead of just
    opened, is the most recent file.
    * gnome-inform7.glade, datafile.c: Cosmetic changes.
    * Release 0.3

Sat May 26 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * data/Documentation/*: Reinstated the "click to paste" icons in the
    documentation, thanks to Adam Thornton.
    * configure.in, compile.c, e2fsuuid.html: Now the program will compile
    with either one of the OSSP uuid or e2fsprogs uuid libraries. If both
    are available, it will use OSSP uuid. Thanks to Daniel Nilsson for the
    patch.

Sun May 20 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * file.c, extension.c: Fixed a bug that sometimes generated a warning
    when removing a file monitor.
    * THANKS: Started maintaining the THANKS file with the names of people
    who reported bugs or suggested features.
    * spawn.c, compile.c, appwindow.c: Running the NI compiler now updates
    the progress bar, and running the I6 compiler pulses the progress bar.
    * tabindex.c: Reloading the index now updates the progress bar.
    * compile.c: Achieved a massive speed improvement by not loading the
    debug log and I6 code when the user doesn't have those tabs switched on.
    * tabgame.c: Changed the interpreter invocations to include the full
    path of the story, even though the command starts in the same working
    directory. This _might_ solve the problem of the interpreter not finding
    the file.
    
Sat May 19 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * tabsource.c: Fixed a bug that made the highlighting routine go into an
    infinite loop if text was typed or pasted with an unmatched ] inside a
    string.
    * windowlist.c: Fixed a small type bug/memory leak.
    * ErrorTerp.html: Changed error message to refer to Linux version
    instead of Windows version.
    * doc3.html, doc4.html, doc5.html, doc6.html, doc10.html: Changed pages
    to refer to the GUI version instead of the command line version.
    * data/*, **/Makefile.am: Updated to Public Beta build 4U65.

Thu Apr 26 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * appwindow.c, file.c, welcomedialog.c: Applied Adam Thornton's patch to
    make the program compile without the recent manager on systems without
    GTK 2.10.
    * main.c: Reduced the required version of GTK to 2.8.

Tue Apr 24 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	* configfile.h: Removed function definitions that were not in
	configfile.c anymore.

Sat Apr 21 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

    * file.c: Installing extensions now recognize all combinations of
    newline characters as valid. Installed extensions are converted to Unix
    style newlines.
    * prefs.c: Fixed a bug in graying out of invalid settings.
    * prefs.c, inspector.c, tabsource.c: Added code to prevent pileups of
    some idle functions.

Sun Apr 15 2007  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	name conflict is no longer necessary.

Sun Oct 22 2006  P.F. Chimento <philip.chimento@gmail.com>

	items: File/Revert and Game/Rebuild Index. They do nothing so far.
