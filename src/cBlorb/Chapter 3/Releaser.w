3/rel: Releaser.

@Purpose: To manage requests to release material other than a Blorb file.

@Interface:

-- Owns struct request (private)

@Definitions:

@ If the previous section, "Blorb Writer.w", was the Lord High Executioner,
then this one is the Lord High Everything Else: it keeps track of requests
to write all kinds of interesting things which are {\it not} blorb files,
and then sees that they are carried out. The requests divide as follows:

@d COPY_REQ 0 /* a miscellaneous file */
@d IFICTION_REQ 1 /* the iFiction record of a project */
@d RELEASE_FILE_REQ 2 /* a template file */
@d RELEASE_SOURCE_REQ 3 /* the source text in HTML form */
@d SOLUTION_REQ 4 /* a solution file generated from the skein */
@d SOURCE_REQ 5 /* the source text of a project */
@d WEBSITE_REQ 6 /* a whole website */
@d INTERPRETER_REQ 7 /* an in-browser interpreter */
@d BASE64_REQ 8 /* a base64-encoded copy of a binary file */
@d INSTRUCTION_REQ 9 /* a release instruction copied to cblorb for reporting only */
@d ALTERNATIVE_REQ 10 /* an unused release instruction copied to cblorb for reporting only */

@c
int website_requested = FALSE; /* has a |WEBSITE_REQ| been made? */

@ This would use a lot of memory if there were many requests, but there are
not and it does not.

@c
typedef struct request {
	int what_is_requested; /* one of the |*_REQ| values above */
	char details1[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];
	char details2[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];
	char details3[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];
	int private; /* is this request private, i.e., not to contribute to a website? */
	int outcome_data; /* e.g. number of bytes copied */
	MEMORY_MANAGEMENT
} request;

@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@p Receiving requests.
These can have from 0 to 3 textual details attached:

@c
request *request_0(int kind, int privacy) {
	request *req = CREATE(request);
	req->what_is_requested = kind;
	req->details1[0] = 0;
	req->details2[0] = 0;
	req->details3[0] = 0;
	req->private = privacy;
	req->outcome_data = 0;
	if (kind == WEBSITE_REQ) website_requested = TRUE;
	return req;
}

request *request_1(int kind, char *text1, int privacy) {
	request *req = request_0(kind, privacy);
	strcpy(req->details1, text1);
	return req;
}

request *request_2(int kind, char *text1, char *text2, int privacy) {
	request *req = request_0(kind, privacy);
	strcpy(req->details1, text1);
	strcpy(req->details2, text2);
	return req;
}

request *request_3(int kind, char *text1, char *text2, char *text3, int privacy) {
	request *req = request_0(kind, privacy);
	strcpy(req->details1, text1);
	strcpy(req->details2, text2);
	strcpy(req->details3, text3);
	return req;
}

@ A convenient abbreviation:

@c
void request_copy(char *from, char *to, char *subfolder) {
	request_3(COPY_REQ, from, to, subfolder, FALSE);
}

@p Any Last Requests.
Most of the requests are made as the parser reads commands from the blurb
script. At the end of that process, though, the following routine may add
further requests as consequences:

@c
void any_last_requests(void) {
	request_copy_of_auxiliaries();
	if (default_cover_used == FALSE) {
		char *BIGCOVER = read_placeholder("BIGCOVER");
		if (BIGCOVER) {
			if (cover_is_in_JPEG_format) request_copy(BIGCOVER, "Cover.jpg", "--");
			else request_copy(BIGCOVER, "Cover.png", "--");
		}
		if (website_requested) {
			char *SMALLCOVER = read_placeholder("SMALLCOVER");
			if (SMALLCOVER) {
				if (cover_is_in_JPEG_format) request_copy(SMALLCOVER, "Small Cover.jpg", "--");
				else request_copy(SMALLCOVER, "Small Cover.png", "--");
			}
		}
	}
}

@p Carrying out requests.

@c
void create_requested_material(void) {
	if (release_folder[0] == 0) return;
	printf("! Release folder: <%s>\n", release_folder);
	if (blorb_file_size > 0) declare_where_blorb_should_be_copied(release_folder);
	any_last_requests();
	request *req;
	LOOP_OVER(req, request) {
		switch (req->what_is_requested) {
			case ALTERNATIVE_REQ: break;

@ Interpreters are copied, not made. They're really just like website
templates, except that they have a manifest file instead of an extras file,
and that they're copied into an |interpreter| subfolder of the release folder,
which is assumed already to exist. (It isn't copied because folder creation
is tiresome to do in a cross-platform way, since Windows doesn't follow POSIX.
The necessary code exists in Inform already, so we'll do it there.)

@<Create an in-browser interpreter@> =
	set_placeholder_to("INTERPRETER", req->details1, 0);
	char *t = read_placeholder("INTERPRETER");
	char *from = find_file_in_named_template(t, "(manifest).txt");
	if (from) { /* i.e., if the "(manifest).txt" file exists */
		file_read(from, "can't open (manifest) file", FALSE, read_requested_ifile, 0);
	}

@ We copy the CSS file, if we need one; make the home page; and make any
other pages demanded by public released material. After that, it's up to
the template to add more if it wants to.

@<Create a website@> =
	set_placeholder_to("TEMPLATE", req->details1, 0);
	char *t = read_placeholder("TEMPLATE");
	if (use_css_code_styles) {
		char *from = find_file_in_named_template(t, "style.css");
		if (from) {
			char CSS_filename[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];
			sprintf(CSS_filename, "%s%cstyle.css", release_folder, SEP_CHAR);
			copy_file(from, CSS_filename, FALSE);
		}
	}
	release_file_into_website("index.html", t, NULL);
	request *req;
	LOOP_OVER(req, request)
		if (req->private == FALSE)
			switch (req->what_is_requested) {
				case INTERPRETER_REQ:
					release_file_into_website("play.html", t, NULL); break;
				case SOURCE_REQ:
					set_placeholder_to("SOURCEPREFIX", "source", 0);
						char source_text[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];
					sprintf(source_text, "%s%cSource%cstory.ni",
						project_folder, SEP_CHAR, SEP_CHAR);
					set_placeholder_to("SOURCELOCATION", source_text, 0);
					release_file_into_website("source.html", t, NULL); break;
			}
	@<Add further material as requested by the template@>;

@ Most templates do not request extra files, but they have the option by
including a manifest called "(extras).txt":

@<Add further material as requested by the template@> =
	char *from = find_file_in_named_template(t, "(extras).txt");
	if (from) { /* i.e., if the "(extras).txt" file exists */
		file_read(from, "can't open (extras) file", FALSE, read_requested_file, 0);
	}

@p The Extras file for a website template.
When parsing "(extras).txt", |read_requested_file| is called for each line.
We trim white space and expect the result to be a filename of something
within the template.

@c
void read_requested_file(char *filename, text_file_position *tfp) {
	filename = trim_white_space(filename);
	if (filename[0] == 0) return;
	release_file_into_website(filename, read_placeholder("TEMPLATE"), NULL);
}

@p The Manifest file for an interpreter.
When parsing "(manifest).txt", we do almost the same thing. Like a website
template, an interpreter is stored in a single folder, and the manifest can
list files which need to be copied into the Release in order to piece together
a working copy of the interpreter.

However, this is more expressive than the "(extras).txt" file because it
also has the ability to set placeholders in |cblorb|. We use this mechanism
because it allows each interpreter to provide some metadata about its own
identity and exactly how it wants to be interfaced with the website which
|cblorb| will generate. This isn't the place to document what those metadata
placeholders are and what they mean, since (except for a consistency check
below) |cblorb| doesn't know anything about them -- it's the Standard
website template which they need to match up to. Anyway, the best way
to get an idea of this is to read the manifest file for the default,
Parchment, interpreter.

@c
char current_placeholder[MAX_VAR_NAME_LENGTH];
int cp_written = FALSE;
void read_requested_ifile(char *manifestline, text_file_position *tfp) {
	if (cp_written == FALSE) { cp_written = TRUE; current_placeholder[0] = 0; }
	manifestline = trim_white_space(manifestline);
	if (manifestline[0] == '[') @<Go into or out of placeholder setting mode@>;
	if (current_placeholder[0] == 0)
		@<We're outside placeholder mode, so it's a comment or a manifested filename@>
	else
		@<We're inside placeholder mode, so it's content to be spooled into the named placeholder@>;
}

@ Placeholders are set thus:

	|[INTERPRETERVERSION]|
	|Parchment for Inform 7|
	|[]|

where the opening line names the placeholder, then one or more lines give
the contents, and the box line ends the definition.

We're in the mode if |current_placeholder| is a non-empty C string, and
if so, then it's the name of the one being set. Thus the code to handle
the opening and closing lines can be identical.

@<Go into or out of placeholder setting mode@> =
	if (manifestline[cblorb_strlen(manifestline)-1] == ']') {
		if (cblorb_strlen(manifestline) >= MAX_VAR_NAME_LENGTH) {
			error_1("placeholder name too long in manifest file", manifestline);
			return;
		}
		strcpy(current_placeholder, manifestline+1);
		current_placeholder[cblorb_strlen(current_placeholder)-1] = 0;
		return;
	}
	error_1("placeholder name lacks ']' in manifest file", manifestline);
	return;

@ Outside of placeholders, blank lines and lines introduced by the comment
character |!| are skipped.

@<We're outside placeholder mode, so it's a comment or a manifested filename@> =
	if ((manifestline[0] == '!') || (manifestline[0] == 0)) return;
	release_file_into_website(manifestline, read_placeholder("INTERPRETER"), "interpreter");

@ Line breaks are included between lines, though not at the end of the final
line, so that a one-line definition like the example above contains no line
break. White space is stripped out at the left and right hand edges of
each line.

@<We're inside placeholder mode, so it's content to be spooled into the named placeholder@> =
	if (strcmp(current_placeholder, "INTERPRETERVM") == 0)
		@<Check the value being given against the actual VM we're blorbing up@>;
	if (read_placeholder(current_placeholder))
		append_to_placeholder(current_placeholder, "\n");
	append_to_placeholder(current_placeholder, manifestline);

@ Perhaps it's clumsy to do it here, but at some point |cblorb| needs to
make sure we aren't trying to release a Z-machine game along with a
Glulx interpreter, or vice versa. The manifest file for the interpreter
is required to declare which virtual machines it implements, by giving a
value of the placeholder |INTERPRETERVM|. This declares whether the interpreter
can handle blorbed Z-machine files (|z|), blorbed Glulx files (|g|) or both
(|zg| or |gz|). No other values are legal; note lower case. |cblorb| then
checks this against its own placeholder |INTERPRETERVMIS|, which stores
what the actual format of the blorb being released is.

@<Check the value being given against the actual VM we're blorbing up@> =
	char *vm_used = read_placeholder("INTERPRETERVMIS");
	int i, capable = FALSE;
	for (i=0; manifestline[i]; i++)
		if (vm_used[0] == manifestline[i]) capable = TRUE;
	if (capable == FALSE) {
		char *format = "Z-machine";
		if (vm_used[0] == 'g') format = "Glulx";
		errorf_2s(
			"You asked to release along with a copy of the '%s' in-browser "
			"interpreter, but this can't handle story files which use the "
			"%s story file format. (The format can be changed on Inform's "
			"Settings panel for a project.)",
			read_placeholder("INTERPRETER"), format);
	}

@ There are really three cases when we release something from a website
template. We can copy it verbatim as a binary file, we can expand placeholders
but otherwise copy as a single item, or we can use it to make a mass
generation of source pages.

@c
void release_file_into_website(char *name, char *t, char *sub) {
	char write_to[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];
	if (sub) sprintf(write_to, "%s%c%s%c%s",
		release_folder, SEP_CHAR, sub, SEP_CHAR, name);
	else sprintf(write_to, "%s%c%s", release_folder, SEP_CHAR, name);
	
	char *from = find_file_in_named_template(t, name);
	if (from == NULL) {
		error_1("unable to find file in website template", name);
		return;
	}

	if (infer_format_from_filename_extension(name) == FORMAT_PERHAPS_HTML)
		@<Release an HTML page from the template into the website@>
	else
		@<Release a binary file from the template into the website@>;
}

@ "Source.html" is a special case, as it expands into a whole suite of
pages automagically. Otherwise we work out the filenames and then hand over
to the experts.

@<Release an HTML page from the template into the website@> =
	set_placeholder_to("TEMPLATE", t, 0);
	if (trace_mode) printf("! Web page %s from template %s\n", name, t);
	if (strcmp(name, "source.html") == 0)
		web_copy_source(from, release_folder);
	else
		web_copy(from, write_to);

@

@<Release a binary file from the template into the website@> =
	if (trace_mode) printf("! Binary file %s from template %s\n", name, t);
	copy_file(from, write_to, FALSE);

@ The home page will need links to any public released resources, and this
is where those are added (to the other links already present, that is).

@c
void add_links_to_requested_resources(FILE *COPYTO) {
	request *req;
	LOOP_OVER(req, request)
		if (req->private == FALSE)
			switch (req->what_is_requested) {
				case WEBSITE_REQ: break;
				case INTERPRETER_REQ:
					fprintf(COPYTO, "<li>");
					download_link(COPYTO, "Play In-Browser", NULL, "play.html", "link");
					fprintf(COPYTO, "</li>");
					break;
				case SOURCE_REQ:
					fprintf(COPYTO, "<li>");
					download_link(COPYTO, "Source Text", NULL, "source.html", "link");
					fprintf(COPYTO, "</li>");
					break;
				case SOLUTION_REQ:
					fprintf(COPYTO, "<li>");
					download_link(COPYTO, "Solution", NULL, "solution.txt", "link");
					fprintf(COPYTO, "</li>");
					break;
				case IFICTION_REQ:
					fprintf(COPYTO, "<li>");
					download_link(COPYTO, "Library Card", NULL, "iFiction.xml", "link");
					fprintf(COPYTO, "</li>");
					break;
			}
}

@p Blorb relocation.
This is a little dodge used to make the process of releasing games in
Inform 7 more seamless: see the manual for an explanation.

@c
void declare_where_blorb_should_be_copied(char *path) {
	char *leaf = read_placeholder("STORYFILE");
	if (leaf == NULL) leaf = "Story";
	printf("Copy blorb to: [[%s%c%s]]\n", path, SEP_CHAR, leaf);
}

@p Reporting the release.
Inform normally asks |cblorb| to generate an HTML page reporting what it has
done, and if things have gone well then this typically contains a list of
what has been released. (That's easy for us to produce, since we just have to
look through the requests.) Rather than attempt to write to the file here,
we copy the necessary HTML into the placeholder |ph|.

@c

@ These two links are handled by means of LAUNCH icons which, if clicked,
open the relevant pages not in the Inform application but using an external
web browser (e.g., Safari on most Mac OS X installations). We can only
achieve this effect using a Javascript function provided by the Inform
application, called |openUrl|.

@ Since |cblorb| has no knowledge of what the Inform source text producing
this blorb was, it can't finish the status report from its own knowledge --
it must rely on details supplied to it by Inform via blurb commands. First,
Inform gives it source-text links for any "Release along with..." sentences,
which have by now become |INSTRUCTION_REQ| requests:

@<Add in links to release instructions from Inform source text@> =
	request *req;
	int count = 0;
	LOOP_OVER(req, request)
		if (req->what_is_requested == INSTRUCTION_REQ) {
			if (count == 0)
				append_to_placeholder(ph, "<p>The source text gives release instructions ");
			else
				append_to_placeholder(ph, " and ");
			append_to_placeholder(ph, req->details1);
			append_to_placeholder(ph, " here");
			count++;
		}
	if (count > 0)
		append_to_placeholder(ph, ".</p>");

@ And secondly, Inform gives it adverts for other fancy services on offer,
complete with links to the Inform documentation (which, again, |cblorb|

requests.

@<Add in advertisements for features Inform would like to offer@> =

	LOOP_OVER(req, request)
		if (req->what_is_requested == ALTERNATIVE_REQ) {
			if (count == 0)

					"<p>Here are some other possibilities you might want to consider:<p><ul>");

			append_to_placeholder(ph, req->details1);
			append_to_placeholder(ph, "</li>");
			count++;

	if (count > 0)

@ A convenient way to see if we've received requests of any given type:

@c
int count_requests_of_type(int t) {
	request *req;
	int count = 0;
	LOOP_OVER(req, request)
		if (req->what_is_requested == t)
			count++;
	return count;
}
