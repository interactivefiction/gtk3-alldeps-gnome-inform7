1/main: Main.

@Purpose: To parse command-line arguments and take the necessary steps to
obey them.

@Definitions:

@ We will need the following:

@c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <ctype.h>

@ We identify which platform we're running on thus:

@d OSX_PLATFORM 1
@d WINDOWS_PLATFORM 2
@d UNIX_PLATFORM 3

@ Since we use flexible-sized memory allocation, |cblorb| contains few hard
maxima on the size or complexity of its input, but:

@d MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH 10240 /* total length of pathname including leaf and extension */
@d MAX_EXTENSION_LENGTH 32 /* extension part of filename, for auxiliary files */
@d MAX_VAR_NAME_LENGTH 32 /* length of name of placeholder variable like "[AUTHOR]" */
@d MAX_TEXT_FILE_LINE_LENGTH 51200 /* for any single line in the project's source text */
@d MAX_SOURCE_TEXT_LINES 2000000000; /* enough for 300 copies of the Linux kernel source -- plenty! */

@ Miscellaneous settings:

@d VERSION "cBlorb 1.2"

@d TRUE 1
@d FALSE 0

@ The following variables record HTML and Javascript-related points where
|cblorb| needs to behave differently on the different platforms. The default
values here aren't actually correct for any platform as they stand: in the
|main| routine below, we set them as needed.

@c
char SEP_CHAR = '/'; /* local file-system filename separator */
char *FONT_TAG = "size=2"; /* contents of a |<font>| tag */
char *JAVASCRIPT_PRELUDE = "javascript:window.Project."; /* calling prefix */
int escape_openUrl = FALSE, escape_fileUrl = FALSE;
int reverse_slash_openUrl = FALSE, reverse_slash_fileUrl = FALSE;

@ Some global variables:

@c
int trace_mode = FALSE; /* print diagnostics to |stdout| while running? */
int error_count = 0; /* number of error messages produced so far */
int current_year_AD = 0; /* e.g., 2008 */

int blorb_file_size = 0; /* size in bytes of the blorb file written */
int no_pictures_included = 0; /* number of picture resources included in the blorb */
int no_sounds_included = 0; /* number of sound resources included in the blorb */
int HTML_pages_created = 0; /* number of pages created in the website, if any */
int source_HTML_pages_created = 0; /* number of those holding source */
int sound_resource_num = 3; /* current sound resource number we're working on */
int picture_resource_num = 1; /* current picture resource number we're working on */

int use_css_code_styles = FALSE; /* use |<span class="X">| markings when setting code */
char project_folder[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH]; /* pathname of I7 project folder, if any */
char release_folder[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH]; /* pathname of folder for website to write, if any */
char status_template[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH]; /* filename of report HTML page template, if any */
char status_file[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH]; /* filename of report HTML page to write, if any */
int cover_exists = FALSE; /* an image is specified as cover art */
int default_cover_used = FALSE; /* but it's only the default supplied by Inform */
int cover_is_in_JPEG_format = TRUE; /* as opposed to |PNG| format */

@pp Main.
Like most programs, this one parses command-line arguments, sets things up,
reads the input and then writes the output.

That's a little over-simplified, though, because it also produces auxiliary
outputs along the way, in the course of parsing the blurb file. The blorb
file is only the main output -- there might also be a web page and a solution
file, for instance.

@c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	int platform, produce_help;
	char blurb_filename[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];
	char blorb_filename[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];

	@<Make the default settings@>;
	@<Parse command-line arguments@>;

	start_memory();
	establish_time();
	initialise_placeholders();
	print_banner();

	if (produce_help) { @<Produce help@>; return 0; }

	parse_blurb_file(blurb_filename);
	write_blorb_file(blorb_filename);
	create_requested_material();
	
	print_report();
	free_memory();
	if (error_count > 0) return 1;
	return 0;
}

@

@<Make the default settings@> =
	platform = OSX_PLATFORM;
	produce_help = FALSE;
	release_folder[0] = 0;
	project_folder[0] = 0;
	status_file[0] = 0;
	status_template[0] = 0;
	strcpy(blurb_filename, "Release.blurb");
	strcpy(blorb_filename, "story.zblorb");

@

@<Parse command-line arguments@> =
	int arg, names;
	for (arg = 1, names = 0; arg < argc; arg++) {
		char *p = argv[arg];
		if (cblorb_strlen(p) >= MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH) {
			fprintf(stderr, "cblorb: command line argument %d too long\n", arg+1);
			return 1;
		}
		@<Parse an individual command-line argument@>;
	}
	
	@<Set platform-dependent HTML and Javascript variables@>;
	
	if (project_folder[0] != 0) {
		if (names > 0) @<Command line syntax error@>;
		sprintf(blurb_filename, "%s%cRelease.blurb", project_folder, SEP_CHAR);
		sprintf(blorb_filename, "%s%cBuild%coutput.zblorb", project_folder, SEP_CHAR, SEP_CHAR);
	}

	if (trace_mode)
		printf("! Blurb in: <%s>\n! Blorb out: <%s>\n",
			blurb_filename, blorb_filename);
		
@

@<Parse an individual command-line argument@> =
	if (strcmp(p, "-help") == 0) { produce_help = TRUE; continue; }
	if (strcmp(p, "-osx") == 0) { platform = OSX_PLATFORM; continue; }
	if (strcmp(p, "-windows") == 0) { platform = WINDOWS_PLATFORM; continue; }
	if (strcmp(p, "-unix") == 0) { platform = UNIX_PLATFORM; continue; }
	if (strcmp(p, "-trace") == 0) { trace_mode = TRUE; continue; }
	if (strcmp(p, "-project") == 0) {
		arg++; if (arg == argc) @<Command line syntax error@>;
		strcpy(project_folder, argv[arg]);
		continue;
	}
	if (p[0] == '-') @<Command line syntax error@>;
	names++;
	switch (names) {
		case 1: strcpy(blurb_filename, p); break;
		case 2: strcpy(blorb_filename, p); break;
		default: @<Command line syntax error@>;
	}

@ Now let's set the platform-dependent variables -- all of which depend only
on the value of |platform|.

|cblorb| generates quite a variety of HTML, for instance to create websites,
but the tricky points below affect only one special page not browsed by
the general public: the results page usually called |StatusCblorb.html|
(though this depends on how the |status| command is used in the blurb).
The results page is intended only for viewing within the Inform user
interface, and it expects to have two Javascript functions available,
|openUrl| and |fileUrl|. Because the object structure has needed to be
different for the Windows and OS X user interface implementations of
Javascript, we abstract the prefix for these function calls into the
|JAVASCRIPT_PRELUDE|. Thus

	|<a href="***openUrl">...</a>|

causes a link, when clicked, to call the |openUrl| function, where |***|
is the prelude; similarly for |fileUrl|. The first opens a URL in the local
operating system's default web browser, the second opens a file (identified
by a |file:...| URL) in the local operating system. These two URLs may
need treatment to handle special characters:

(a) "escaping", where spaces in the URL are escaped to |%2520|, which
within a Javascript string literal produces |%20|, the standard way to
represent a space in a web URL;

(b) "reversing slashes", where backslashes are converted to forward
slashes -- useful if the separation character is a backslash, as on Windows,
since backslashes are escape characters in Javascript literals.

@<Set platform-dependent HTML and Javascript variables@> =
	if (platform == OSX_PLATFORM) {
		FONT_TAG = "face=\"lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv\" size=2";
		escape_openUrl = TRUE; /* OS X requires |openUrl| to escape, and |fileUrl| not to */
	}
	if (platform == WINDOWS_PLATFORM) {
		SEP_CHAR = '\\';
		JAVASCRIPT_PRELUDE = "javascript:external.Project.";
		reverse_slash_openUrl = TRUE; reverse_slash_fileUrl = TRUE;
	}

@

@<Produce help@> =
	printf("This is cblorb, a component of Inform 7 for packaging up IF materials.\n\n");
	@<Show command line usage@>;
	summarise_blurb();

@

@<Command line syntax error@> =
	@<Show command line usage@>;
	return 1;

@

@<Show command line usage@> =
	printf("usage: cblorb -platform [-options] [blurbfile [blorbfile]]\n\n");
	printf("  Where -platform should be -osx (default), -windows, or -unix\n");
	printf("  As an alternative to giving filenames for the blurb and blorb,\n");
	printf("    -project Whatever.inform\n");
	printf("  sets blurbfile and blorbfile names to the natural choices.\n");
	printf("  The other possible options are:\n");
	printf("    -help ... print this usage summary\n");
	printf("    -trace ... print diagnostic information during run\n");

@p Time.
It wouldn't be a tremendous disaster if the host OS had no access to an
accurate time of day, in fact.

@c
time_t the_present;
struct tm *here_and_now;

void establish_time(void) {
	the_present = time(NULL);
	here_and_now = localtime(&the_present);
}

@ The placeholder variable [YEAR] is initialised to the year in which |cBlorb|
runs, according to the host operating system, at least. (It can of course then
be overridden by commands in the blurb file, and Inform always does this in
the blurb files it writes. But it leaves [DATESTAMP] and [TIMESTAMP] alone.)

@c
void initialise_time_variables(void) {
	char datestamp[100], infocom[100], timestamp[100];
	char *weekdays[] = { "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
		"Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday" };
	char *months[] = { "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
		"July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December" };
	set_placeholder_to_number("YEAR", here_and_now->tm_year+1900);
	sprintf(datestamp, "%s %d %s %d", weekdays[here_and_now->tm_wday],
		here_and_now->tm_mday, months[here_and_now->tm_mon], here_and_now->tm_year+1900);
	sprintf(infocom, "%02d%02d%02d",
		here_and_now->tm_year-100, here_and_now->tm_mon + 1, here_and_now->tm_mday);
	sprintf(timestamp, "%02d:%02d.%02d", here_and_now->tm_hour,
		here_and_now->tm_min, here_and_now->tm_sec);
	set_placeholder_to("DATESTAMP", datestamp, 0);
	set_placeholder_to("INFOCOMDATESTAMP", infocom, 0);
	set_placeholder_to("TIMESTAMP", timestamp, 0);
}

@p Opening and closing banners.
Note that |cBlorb| customarily prints informational messages with an initial
|!|, so that the piped output from |cBlorb| could be used as an |Include|
file in I6 code; that isn't in fact how I7 uses |cBlorb|, but it's traditional
for blorbing programs to do this.

@c
void print_banner(void) {
	printf("! %s [executing on %s at %s]\n",
		VERSION, read_placeholder("DATESTAMP"), read_placeholder("TIMESTAMP"));
	printf("! The blorb spell (safely protect a small object ");
	printf("as though in a strong box).\n");
}

@ The concluding banner is much smaller -- empty if all went well, a single
comment line if not. But we also generate the status report page (if that has
been requested) -- a single HTML file generated from a template by expanding
placeholders in the template. All of the meat of the report is in those
placeholders, of course; the template contains only some fancy formatting.

@c
void print_report(void) {
	if (error_count > 0) printf("! Completed: %d error(s)\n", error_count);
	@<Set a whole pile of placeholders which will be needed to generate the status page@>;
	if (status_template[0]) web_copy(status_template, status_file);
}

@ If it isn't apparent what these placeholders do, take a look at
the template file for |StatusCblorb.html| in the Inform application -- that's
where they're used.

@<Set a whole pile of placeholders which will be needed to generate the status page@> =
	if (error_count > 0) {
		set_placeholder_to("CBLORBSTATUS", "Failed", 0);
		set_placeholder_to("CBLORBSTATUSIMAGE", "inform:/outcome_images/cblorb_failed.png", 0);
		set_placeholder_to("CBLORBSTATUSTEXT",
			"Inform translated your source text as usual, to manufacture a 'story "
			"file': all of that worked fine. But the Release then went wrong, for "
			"the following reason:<p><ul>[CBLORBERRORS]</ul>", 0
		);
	} else {
		set_placeholder_to("CBLORBERRORS", "No problems occurred", 0);
		set_placeholder_to("CBLORBSTATUS", "Succeeded", 0);
		set_placeholder_to("CBLORBSTATUSIMAGE", "file://[SMALLCOVER]", 0);

			"the blue folders above.<p>"
			"Releases can range in size from a single blorb file to a medium-sized website. "
			"Here's what we currently have:<p>", 0
		);
		report_requested_material("CBLORBSTATUSTEXT");
	}
	if (blorb_file_size > 0) {
		set_placeholder_to_number("BLORBFILESIZE", blorb_file_size/1024);
		set_placeholder_to_number("BLORBFILEPICTURES", no_pictures_included);
