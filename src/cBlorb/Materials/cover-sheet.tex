|cblorb| is a command-line tool which forms one of the components of the
Inform 7 design system for interactive fiction. All installations of Inform
7 contain a copy of |cblorb|, though few users are aware of it, since it
doesn't usually communicate with them directly. Instead, the Inform user
interface calls it when needed. The moment comes at the end of the
translation process, but only when the Release button rather than the Go or
Replay buttons was clicked. |cblorb| has two main jobs: to bind up the
translated project, together with any pictures, sounds, or cover art, into
a single file called a ``blorb'' which can be given to players on other
machines to play; and to produce associated websites, solution files and so
on as demanded by ``Release...'' instruction(s) in the source text.
