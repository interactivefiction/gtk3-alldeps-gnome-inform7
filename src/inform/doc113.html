<p>We come at last to the final thing which can be specified about an action, and appropriately enough it must be specified with the final words of the description. This is the way to talk about repeated activity:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that we are allowed to spell out numbers up to twelve in English words, but beyond that must use digits (thus &quot;twelfth&quot; is allowed but not &quot;thirteenth&quot;: &quot;13th&quot; should be used instead). The following example is instructive:</p>

<a id="c1615"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of taking something for the fourth time, say &quot;No. I'm capricious.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This means that it is the fourth time a &quot;taking...&quot; action has been tried, and does not mean that the same item was taken each time. Also, note that we are counting the number of times the action has been tried, not the number of times it succeeded.</p>

<p>Suppose we'd like to watch for signs that the player is floundering, and if we see them, recommend that he try the hints. There are probably more sophisticated diagnostics, but as a first cut, let's assume that a player who repeatedly reviews descriptions of objects he's already seen, looks around the room, and takes inventory, is at a loss for more productive activities. So then...</p>

<p>The following is an almost-completely-faithful rewrite of Emily Short's &quot;A Day for Fresh Sushi&quot;, which was originally written using the (very different) Inform 6 programming language. The -- let us be honest and call it a gimmick -- of this game is the evil fish, who has some unpleasant remark to offer on pretty much every action. But the effect would wear off fast if he repeated himself, so these comments need to be single-use only.</p>
<p>Inform 7's repeated action syntax makes it much tidier to write the same scenario, so:</p>
