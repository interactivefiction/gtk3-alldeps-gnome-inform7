<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.5. Examining</p>
<p>By default, examining an object shows its description, and - for devices - tells us whether the object is switched on or switched off.</p>
<p>This kind of additional information is not always what we want, so if we have a device whose on/off status we want to conceal, we may write</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11448" -->
<a id="c11448"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The examine described devices rule is not listed in any rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>On the other hand, there are times when we may want to add a similar line or two to the descriptions of other kinds of objects. <span class="boldface">Crusoe</span> allows us to append an &quot;It is charred.&quot; sentence to the end of descriptions of things we have burned in the fire. Since it works by introducing a &quot;printing the description&quot; activity, Crusoe is also a good example to start from if we want to introduce more complex, flexible descriptions of items throughout our story.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Odin</span> rewrites the &quot;You see nothing special...&quot; line with other text of our own, for items that otherwise do not have a description.</p>
<p>Finally, we may want to look at multiple things at once. <span class="boldface">The Left Hand of Autumn</span> demonstrates how we might provide a different response for EXAMINE PAINTINGS than for examining each individually; <span class="boldface">Beekeeper's Apprentice</span> provides a SEARCH command that will show the descriptions of all the scenery in the current location.</p>

<p>In recent years there has been a strong trend towards providing unique descriptions for all implemented objects. Often this is a good idea, but there are also contexts in which we may want to discourage the player from looking too closely at some things and concentrate his attention on just a few interesting ones.</p>
<p>The trick here is that leaving items completely undescribed leads to rather dull exchanges like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11449_145" -->
<a id="c11449_145"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;x table
<br />You see nothing special about the table.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...which can leave the player with the impression that the author was simply too lazy to describe everything. So it can be a good idea to replace that default message with a different one more appropriate to the game. For instance:</p>

<p>Suppose we want to add rules so that any time we examine a charred object (and most of our objects can be charred), a line about the charring is appended to the end of the object description. We could use &quot;after examining...&quot;, but perhaps we would prefer for the sentence about the charring not to appear in its own paragraph.</p>
<p>This is an ideal occasion for a new activity. We look at the action index for &quot;examining&quot; to identify the rule that causes the old behavior (in this case, the &quot;standard examining rule&quot;); replace this with a new rule that calls our activity; and write our &quot;printing the description&quot; activity in such a way that it uses an object's description without forcing a paragraph return afterward.</p>
<p>Then we will use &quot;after printing the description&quot; to add our line about charring, and make sure that the paragraph return does occur before the prompt.</p>

<p>All we have done here is enclose what is usually just a rule inside an activity. This means that we can now write before and after rules for the activity, and also add special instructions like &quot;Rule for printing the name of something while printing the description of something&quot; -- this may not be likely to arise often, but Inform now has the concept of &quot;printing the description of something&quot; as a separate context of action. Next we add the modification that lets us append to the description without a new line:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11499_367" -->
<a id="c11499_367"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the description of something (called item):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the description of the item is not &quot;&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[description of item] [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You see nothing special about [the item]. [run paragraph on]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;run paragraph on&quot; here will mean that we do not get a paragraph break following the description, even if it ends with a period. We also insert a space, so that our follow-on comments will be properly punctuated.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11500_367" -->
<a id="c11500_367"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After printing the description of something charred:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;It is charred.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The instead at the end of this line stops Inform for going on with any other &quot;after printing the description of...&quot; rules.</p>
<p>The standard library also has rules for printing additional text about containers and supporters with visible contents, and devices that are switched on; with this current system, we could add those as &quot;after printing the description&quot; rules as well, building up a complete paragraph if we wanted. But for simplicity we won't exemplify all of that here. The effects would be much the same as with the &quot;charred&quot; line.</p>
<p>Now, because we want to make sure that we always do get a paragraph break after our description, we add this rule last after all the other rules. &quot;Last&quot; and &quot;first&quot; rules are covered in more detail in the chapter on rulebooks.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11501_367" -->
<a id="c11501_367"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Last after printing the description of something:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say paragraph break.

The Desert Isle is a room. &quot;A pale expanse of sand, here and there developing into hillocks of grass, and a small clump of palms. The water is shallow here, and there are other islands within swimming distance -- or even wading distance, perhaps -- but none of them is any larger than your island, so it doesn't seem worth the trouble of visiting.

<p>The player's description is handled in an unusual way, and this will produce a space paragraph break there where it should not. Instead, therefore, we will add an instead for examining the player (probably a good idea anyway):</p>
