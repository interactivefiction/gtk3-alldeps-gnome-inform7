<p>We are allowed to link the beginning or end of any scene to the beginning or end of any other scene. So, for instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2536" -->
<a id="c2536"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Luggage Trouble is a scene. Luggage Trouble begins when Brief Encounter begins.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Thus the two scenes run concurrently, at least for a while. We can also add that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2537" -->
<a id="c2537"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Luggage Trouble ends when Brief Encounter ends.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This can be useful when a large, complicated scene really contains several smaller sub-scenes.</p>
<p>A special exceptional case is that we can have any scene or scenes starting right at the outset:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2538" -->
<a id="c2538"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Railway Meeting is a scene. Railway Meeting begins when play begins.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When play ends, of course, all scenes end, so there is no need to say that.</p>

<p>For some games, it makes sense to organize the entire game around scenes rather than around locations, moving the player when a new scene begins and laying out new props.</p>
<p>To this end, we might extend Inform's default handling of scenes so that each scene has properties to indicate prop lists and locations, and move objects in and out of play automatically as the scenes change. For instance:</p>

<p>The starting location is the room to which the player should be moved; scenery props are things that need to be put there when the scene begins; inventory props, things that are given to the player when the scene begins; and the description some printed text to introduce the new scene. We may still occasionally need to have recourse to special &quot;When the Dancing-Lesson begins...&quot; rules for individual scenes, but for the most part this allows us to set scenes up in a consistent and predictable way.</p>
<p>Another point that might be slightly less obvious: sometimes we want to announce a change of location to the player when the scene starts, and sometimes we don't. In particular any scene that starts &quot;when play begins&quot; should probably not explicitly describe the entered room, since that would duplicate the description automatically produced on the first turn of play. So we add a property to track whether any given scene should be announcing its location:</p>

A scene can be location-silent or location-loud.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And let's say that we also want to announce each new scene as another &quot;chapter&quot; of the game in play, with a pause before the scene begins.</p>
<p>Here we include &quot;Basic Screen Effects&quot; because it will allow us to pause the game for a keypress, then clear the screen before each new chapter:</p>
