<p class="sectionheading">ยง4.4. Scene Changes</p>
<p>In a plot that takes place over multiple locations or has several distinct scenes, we may want to move the player or change the scenery around him. <span class="boldface">Age of Steam</span> brings a train on and off-stage as the plot requires. <span class="boldface">Meteoric</span> similarly brings a meteor into view at a certain time of day, showing off several implementations depending on whether or not the player is supposed to be able to refer to the meteor after it has gone.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Entrevaux</span> constructs an organized system such that all scenes have their own lists of props and associated locations, and props are moved on and off automatically. Scene changes are also announced with a pause and a new title, such as &quot;Chapter 2: Abduction&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Space Patrol - Stranded on Jupiter</span> inserts an interlude in which the player's possessions and clothes are switched for new ones and the player moved to a new location - and then put back where he started from.</p>

<p>The starting location is the room to which the player should be moved; scenery props are things that need to be put there when the scene begins; inventory props, things that are given to the player when the scene begins; and the description some printed text to introduce the new scene. We may still occasionally need to have recourse to special &quot;When the Dancing-Lesson begins...&quot; rules for individual scenes, but for the most part this allows us to set scenes up in a consistent and predictable way.</p>
<p>Another point that might be slightly less obvious: sometimes we want to announce a change of location to the player when the scene starts, and sometimes we don't. In particular any scene that starts &quot;when play begins&quot; should probably not explicitly describe the entered room, since that would duplicate the description automatically produced on the first turn of play. So we add a property to track whether any given scene should be announcing its location:</p>

<p>And let's say that we also want to announce each new scene as another &quot;chapter&quot; of the game in play, with a pause before the scene begins.</p>
<p>Here we include &quot;Basic Screen Effects&quot; because it will allow us to pause the game for a keypress, then clear the screen before each new chapter:</p>
