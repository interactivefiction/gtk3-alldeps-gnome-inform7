<p class="sectionheading">ยง18.1. What are activities?</p>
<p>It is poor form to define with negatives, but the first thing to say about activities is that they are <span class="italic">not</span> actions. This needs saying because Inform often seems to treat them as if they are, by allowing us to write rules like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6263" -->
<a id="c6263"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before printing the name of a woman, say &quot;Ms &quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>With this rule in place, someone called &quot;Daphne&quot; will always be described as &quot;Ms Daphne&quot;, and so on. The language looks as if we were imposing a rule on an action called &quot;printing the name of&quot;, but there is no such action: instead, it is an &quot;activity&quot;. To spell out the difference:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6264" -->
<a id="c6264"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An action is a simulated task for the fictional protagonist.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c6265" -->
<a id="c6265"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An activity is a real task for the computer program doing the simulation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Activities allow us to influence or change some of the standard habits of Inform, using rules as flexible and powerful as those applicable to actions, though activities are in several ways simpler and easier.</p>

<p class="chapterheading"></p><!-- START EXAMPLE "334: Ant-Sensitive Sunglasses" "e413" -->
<a id="e413"></a><table class="egcue"><tr><td class="egcellforoval"><div class="egovalfornumber overstruckimage">

Controlling output when we want the same action to be able to produce very flexible text depending on the state of the world -- in this case, making highly variable room description and object description text.</p></td><td class="egcrossref"><!-- START IGNORE -->

<a  href="Rdoc8.html#e413"><i>RB</i></a></div>
<!-- END IGNORE -->
</td></tr></table>
<div class="egpanel" id="example413" style="display: none;">
<p>Suppose we want to create an object -- or maybe even a series of objects -- that warp the player's perception of every room description and object around him.</p>
<p>We've already seen some ways to create variations in text. For instance, we could make a room description with if substitutions in it, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6266_413" -->
<a id="c6266_413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Kitchen is a room. &quot;[if the player is wearing the sunglasses]Are ants coming out of the sink? No, probably no.[otherwise]A small kitchen tucked into a corner of the vacation house. There is storage space for five or six cups, a sink, a two-ring stove; nothing else to speak of.[end if]&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That works fine if we have one or two variations we want to add; it's not so good if we're going to have several items that work like the sunglasses, or if we want the sunglasses to override the description of every room in the house.</p>
<p>A slightly more flexible method is to use a substitution that calls out to a say phrase, like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6267_413" -->
<a id="c6267_413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Kitchen is a room. &quot;[kitchen-description]&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c6268_413" -->
<a id="c6268_413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To say kitchen-description:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player is wearing the sunglasses:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Are ants coming out of the sink? No, probably no.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;A small kitchen tucked into a corner of the vacation house. There is storage space for five or six cups, a sink, a two-ring stove; nothing else to speak of.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But again this doesn't handle the case of overriding multiple rooms at once very well.</p>
<p>When we reach a point where we need a given piece of text to be very flexible depending on the world model, it's time to use an activity.</p>
<p>Activities offer several advantages. One, we can create an activity like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6269_413" -->
<a id="c6269_413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Printing the room-description of something is an activity.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and then write a rule that applies to multiple rooms at once, like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6270_413" -->
<a id="c6270_413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the room-description of a room when the player wears the sunglasses:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;The walls look like they're covered with ants. Just a coincidence, I'm sure.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform's usual rule-ranking also means that more-specific rules will override less-specific ones, so we could add</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6271_413" -->
<a id="c6271_413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rule for printing the room-description of the Kitchen when the player wears the sunglasses:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Are ants coming out of the sink? No, probably not.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and have that rule override the behavior of the activity just in the kitchen. Meanwhile, our base room descriptions remain straightforward and uncluttered by if-statements.</p>
<p>Several other examples will show how to hook activities into existing actions: Crusoe goes into detail about how how to make the descriptions of things more variable, and Aftershock demonstrates activities for describing the behavior of switchable devices.</p>
<p>Here, we preview all of those methods, just to get a sense of how they work and why they might be useful in controlling a game. Subsequent chapters go into more detail about the syntax of creating activities and the list of activities that are already defined by Inform.</p>

Part 1 - Procedure
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>To add a new activity to an existing Inform rule, we need to do three things:</p>
<p>1) Define our new activity.</p>
<p>2) Give a basic rule that says what is supposed to happen when that activity occurs, as in &quot;Rule for...&quot;</p>
<p>3) Replace the existing rule in Inform's rulebooks with a new one that calls on our activity.</p>
<p>Here we do this with examining:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now, by default, we want to print the description property; we just want the option to write some extra rules overriding that property. So we tell Inform that our most basic rule for printing the description of something is just to give that description text:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6276_413" -->
<a id="c6276_413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the description of the item is not &quot;&quot;:

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You see nothing special about [the item].&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Next, we need the standard examining rule to look at our printing-the-description activity:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6277_413" -->
<a id="c6277_413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<p>Our replacement rule this time around is a little bit trickier just because the rule that we're replacing is a complicated one: describing a room already checks to see whether there's light to see by, whether the player has turned off room descriptions when he enters a room for the second time, and whether the player character is (say) inside a closed box he can't see out of.</p>
