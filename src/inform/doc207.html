<p class="sectionheading">ยง13.10. Defining new prepositions</p>
<p>The term preposition is used here, a little loosely, to mean anything which we add to the verb <span class="italic">to be</span> in order to talk about some relation or other. We have seen many examples already, such as:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3989" -->
<a id="c3989"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To be in - The ball is in the box.
<br />To be part of - The lever is part of the slot machine.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These are defined just the way verbs are. Compare the following:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3990" -->
<a id="c3990"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Suspicion relates various people to one person.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c3991" -->
<a id="c3991"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to suspect means the suspicion relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c3992" -->
<a id="c3992"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to be suspicious of means the suspicion relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The result of this is that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3993" -->
<a id="c3993"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Hercule Poirot suspects Colonel Hotchkiss.
<br />Hercule Poirot is suspicious of Colonel Hotchkiss.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are exactly equivalent, and so are these two descriptions:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3994" -->
<a id="c3994"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
somebody who suspects Colonel Hotchkiss
<br />somebody suspicious of Colonel Hotchkiss
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>While most prepositions are short (&quot;in&quot;, &quot;part of&quot;, &quot;suspicious of&quot;), they're free to be longer if need be (&quot;inordinately far away from&quot;): the limit is 30 words, which should be ample.</p>
<p>We can also define verbs as auxiliaries, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3995" -->
<a id="c3995"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to be able to approach means the approachability relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we can ask if Poirot &quot;can approach&quot; Hotchkiss, and so on.</p>

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let the final space be a random room which is overlooked by the current space;

<p>Since the Ski-jump overlooks the Landing Bowl, the marble will be able to fly through the air to its destination, even though there is no map connection to allow the player to cross. We might want to let the player make it across this barrier also, so:</p>

<p>We have two things to keep track of with our layering clothing: what currently is covering something else; and what <span class="italic">can</span> cover something else.
