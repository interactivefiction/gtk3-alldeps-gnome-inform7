<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.11. Character Knowledge and Reasoning</p>
<p>A character may be endowed with knowledge and even reasoning skills. Relations form quite a good way of keeping track of such problems: for instance, we can allow characters to be acquainted with one another with a relation such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c12818" -->
<a id="c12818"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Lucy knows Lady Cardew.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or we might keep track of more complicated attitudes between characters, as in <span class="boldface">Murder on the Orient Express</span>, in which some characters suspect others of the crime.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we might have a list of salient facts that are important in our story. We might declare these as values, and then characters could know, learn, and forget entries as appropriate:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c12819" -->
<a id="c12819"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A fact is a kind of value. Some facts are defined by the Table of All Known Facts.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c12820" -->
<a id="c12820"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Knowledge relates various people to various facts. The verb to know (he knows, they know, he knew, it is known) implies the knowledge relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c12821" -->
<a id="c12821"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Table of All Known Facts
<br />fact   	summary
<br />shoe-size   	&quot;Lucy wears a size 9 shoe.&quot;
<br />sunset-time   	&quot;Sunset is at 8:22 PM this evening.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c12822" -->
<a id="c12822"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Lucy knows shoe-size.
<br />Bob knows sunset-time and shoe-size.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or again we might keep a whole database of information in a table: the characters in <span class="boldface">Questionable Revolutions</span> know dates, countries, and a short description for each of several rebellions and popular uprisings, while in <span class="boldface">Queen of Sheba</span>, Solomon is able to answer who, what, where, when, and why questions about a range of topics. This kind of approach is most useful when the characters need to display a deep knowledge of a particular field. The facts stored in the Table of All Known Facts, above, are comparatively sparse, because there we are designing a story in which not all data about the world is equally valuable: Lucy doesn't know the shoe size of every person in the story, because for some reason it is only her own shoe size that matters. On the other hand, the Table of All Known Facts can store different kinds of information, whereas the revolutions table has no way of storing shoe sizes or sunset times. And <span class="boldface">Murder on the Orient Express</span> works differently again, because it is storing knowledge that concerns people and things that already exist in the world model, rather than abstract ideas. Our way of modeling character knowledge, in other words, will depend quite a lot on what kind of knowledge it is.</p>
<p>The possibilities of character reasoning are similarly broad, but <span class="boldface">The Problem of Edith</span> introduces one kind: the character has a concept of how different conversation topics relate to one another, so that when she is asked about a new keyword, she picks a response that makes the question most relevant to the conversation already in progress.</p>
<p>We end with a longer scenario, in which we track what the character knows about the player and the conversational state: in <span class="boldface">Chronic Hinting Syndrome</span>, the main character guides conversation in the direction he intends it to go, with the player's sometimes-reluctant participation.</p>

<p>The moral is that relations allow sophisticated patterns of behaviour to be created in a way that reads back naturally as English.</p>

<p>We have so far seen several ways to write conversational characters in Inform, and we will see more before the end of the manual. This naturally raises the question, which should we use? To which the answer is: it depends on the sort of game we're writing, and what we want our characters to do. The more rich and complex the system, the more likely that it will require a lot of content; if we add question types as well as keywords, for instance, we instantly multiply the number of responses we have to write by five or six. It is not worth doing this unless there is some corresponding advantage within the game.</p>

<p>And now we have a game that will accept (though not always respond very sensibly to) questions of almost any form we might put to another character: ASK SOLOMON WHAT RAIN IS will be answered, but then again, it won't be distinguished from, say, ASK SOLOMON WHETHER THIS PERSISTENT RAIN IS A DIVINE PUNISHMENT OR WHAT.</p>
<p>All the same, a system that allowed the player a bit more specification of questions than simple keyword-use might be useful in a mystery game, for instance, where we might want to let our detective conduct inquiries into specific details. An alternative approach to the rather free one above would be to force the player to use only questions of the form WHAT IS RAIN? or WHO ARE YOU?: this would cut down on false-positive matches. But we might still choose to store the responses in a table of this type.</p>
