<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> See &quot;printing the locale description&quot;. This activity is expected to decide which items ought to be mentioned in a locale description for a given room, enterable container or enterable supporter, and to give each item a priority, which is a number ranging upwards from 1 (which is the top priority). The lower the priority number, the earlier the mention, or at least, the earlier the opportunity to be mentioned: it's up to other activities whether to give it a paragraph of its own or not. This activity only makes something a candidate, and decides what order the candidates will be tried in.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> By default, this activity contains only the &quot;standard notable locale objects rule&quot;. This chooses exactly those items directly contained by the locale, assigning all of them priority 5. Note that this includes scenery, and other probably unwanted items - those will be excluded later.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) In the Misty Moorlands, only large items on the ground are visible through the mist:</p>

<p>which should be used only in rules for locale activities. It makes the given item a candidate and sets its priority. (Setting the priority to 0 forces an item not to be a candidate, and can thus undo the effect of previous rules.)</p>
<p>It's best to avoid situations where an item has a locale priority which is higher than that of something it is on top of, or inside, since this can result in an oddly-worded description.</p>

Section 1 - Procedure

<p>First we create the concept of facts, and the idea that facts can make some things more important than others.</p>

<a id="c6853_61"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A fact is a kind of thing. A fact can be known or unknown. A fact can be ready to learn or hidden. A fact has some text called the narration.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now, we also need a way to tell Inform to introduce certain new facts when the right previous ones have been introduced. We'll create a &quot;following&quot; relation, according to which a new fact can be told to the player when the player has already learned all the facts it follows. This way, we can simulate the effect of putting together several pieces of evidence to come to a conclusion:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6858_61" -->
<a id="c6858_61"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Next we need a way for the game to introduce these new facts. Let's say we want them to come up when the player examines something appropriate, or sees it in the room:</p>

<a id="c6860_61"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;set the locale priority of the notable-object entry to 1.

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[chosen fact][paragraph break]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;after choosing notable locale objects&quot; line here handles things so that any interesting conclusions we want to draw are always given first, followed by the less interesting description.</p>
<p>And finally, we need to give the player a little evidence to piece together:</p>
