<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.21. Understanding mistakes</p>
<p>When inspiration strikes the player, he can usually be relied upon to make a good-faith effort to communicate the new idea: he will guess the right command. If he guesses wrongly, the mistake is probably the author's, because a good author will try to anticipate all possible wordings and make all of them work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is sometimes good practice to nudge the player towards the right wording - particularly if the player has the right idea but is not explicit enough: for instance, typing TALK TO JUDGE when we really want to know what is to be said (JUDGE, GUILTY); or if the player tries something like PLAY CHESS rather than MOVE PAWN TO KING 4. Similarly, if we make a casual reference such as &quot;In your childhood days, you loved sliding in stocking feet across this hallway&quot;, a player might type SLIDE IN STOCKING FEET: a nice idea, and which deserves a nice response, even though it asks to do something beyond the scope of the story.</p>
<p>Inform provides a simple mechanism for recognising a command but at the same time recognising that <span class="italic">it does not properly specify an action</span>. Such commands are called &quot;mistakes&quot;, for the sake of a memorable term, but the player has not really behaved badly, and should be helped rather than reproved. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6159" -->
<a id="c6159"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>While that works - the command to &quot;act&quot; is indeed rejected - it is not very good, because no very helpful message is brought up. The following is much better:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6160" -->
<a id="c6160"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or we could once again insist on a given context:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6161" -->
<a id="c6161"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;) when the location is the Garden Theatre.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That still has the drawback that the command &quot;act hamlet&quot; will not be recognised: so the final version we want is probably</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6162" -->
<a id="c6162"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;act [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;) when the location is the Garden Theatre.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>since the &quot;[text]&quot; part will soak up any words the player types (or none), meaning that any command at all whose first word is &quot;act&quot; will be matched.</p>
<p>We need to be careful to avoid circular things like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6163" -->
<a id="c6163"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;[text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;'[the topic understood]' is something I really wish you wouldn't say.&quot;) when the topic understood is a topic listed in table 1.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This doesn't work because the topic understood isn't set until the line has been understood, but Inform checks the &quot;when...&quot; condition before it tries to understand the line. Indeed, even this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6164" -->
<a id="c6164"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;[text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;'[the topic understood]' is something I really wish you wouldn't say.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is unsafe (quite apart from being unwise!) - again, &quot;topic understood&quot; doesn't exist for a mistake, because in a mistake, nothing is understood.</p>
<p>The following is often useful during beta-testing of a new work, though we would not want it in the final published edition. Many authors like to ask their testers not to try anything in particular, simply to play naturally: but to record the transcript of the session, and email it back to the author. The following command is a device to allow the tester to type a comment in to the transcript:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6165" -->
<a id="c6165"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;* [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Noted.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>For instance, the tester might type &quot;* DIDN'T WE SAY DARCY WAS TALL?&quot;, to which the story would reply &quot;Noted.&quot; - and the author can search for such comments when receiving the transcript.</p>
<p>If we are careful, we can make the reply depend on what was typed in the mistaken command:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6166" -->
<a id="c6166"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;steal [something]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Just TAKE [the noun] and leave without paying: that's stealing in my book.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The care comes in because Inform applies much less checking to mistakes than to other actions, and odd errors will result if we try to refer to (say) &quot;the second noun&quot; in a command which did not have a second noun.</p>
<p>It's probably wise to take particular care if using &quot;as a mistake&quot; with any command which might include the mistake among what the player calls ALL: for example, if &quot;take [sydney harbour bridge]&quot; is understood as a mistake, then TAKE ALL will may result in this, even though the player doesn't intend any such thing.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Now, what if the player tries to GET HOT DISH when the goggles are off? &quot;You can't see any such thing.&quot; doesn't seem like quite the right response: he can see such a thing. He just doesn't know which it is.</p>
<p>We could go on to write a mistake rule that would scold the player for trying &quot;get [heat] [text]&quot; when not wearing the goggles. The problem is that this would not cover any other phrasing of the command, nor would it account for all the many other things the player might try to do with an object specified by heat.</p>
<p>What we really want is to catch all instances of the player using the property name when not allowed to do so; and for this purpose we can borrow a trick from the chapter on Activities:</p>
