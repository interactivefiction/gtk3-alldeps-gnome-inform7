<p>Although it is only useful to a limited extent, we can make any number of copies of something:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c738" -->

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c739" -->
<a id="c739"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A shape is a kind of thing. A square is a kind of shape. A triangle is a kind of shape.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c740" -->
<a id="c740"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Geometry Lab is a room. In the Geometry Lab are three triangles and two squares.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The description &quot;three triangles&quot; makes three identical things, each of the kind &quot;triangle&quot;, and similarly for the squares. When the above is compiled, the player can type TAKE TWO TRIANGLES or TAKE ALL THE TRIANGLES and so forth.</p>
<p>Four caveats. Firstly, a counted-out description like &quot;two squares&quot; is only allowed if it combines a number with the name of a kind which is already known (perhaps modified with adjectives, so &quot;two open doors&quot; is fine). If we say:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c741" -->
<a id="c741"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Two circles are in the Lab.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>without having defined &quot;circle&quot; as a kind in advance, then only a single object will be created - whose name is &quot;two circles&quot;. (This is because many natural names start with numbers: &quot;six of clubs&quot;, for instance, referring to a single playing card, or &quot;12 Hollywood Close&quot; meaning a single house. We wouldn't want such names to be misinterpreted.)</p>
<p>The second caveat is that excessive duplication is expensive in memory and running time. It is perfectly legal to say</p>
<!-- START CODE "c742" -->
<a id="c742"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Lab are 75 triangles.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>but the resulting story may be a little sluggish: and Inform draws the line at 100, refusing to create more duplicates than that in any single place. If we really need more than about fifty duplicated objects - say, a tombola containing raffle tickets numbered 1 to 1000 - it is usually better to find some less literal way to simulate this: for instance, only having a single raffle ticket, but with a randomly chosen number on it.</p>
<p>If there are very many items in the same place, commands like TAKE ALL and DROP ALL may mysteriously not quite deal with all of them - this is because the parser, the run-time program which deciphers typed commands, has only limited memory to hold the possibilities. It can be raised with a use option like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c743" -->
<a id="c743"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Use maximum things understood at once of at least 200.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(The default is, as above, 100. Note the &quot;at least&quot;.)</p>
<p>Thirdly, note that Inform's idea of &quot;identical&quot; is based on what the player could type in a command to distinguish things. In a few cases this can make items unexpectedly identical. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c744" -->
<a id="c744"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Lab is a room. A chemical is a kind of thing. Some polyethylene and polyethylene-terephthalate are chemicals in the Lab.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>results surprisingly in &quot;You can see two chemicals here&quot;, because the run-time system truncates the words that are typed - POLYETHYLENE and POLYETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE look like the same word in a typed command. So Inform decides that these are indistinguishable chemicals. Typically words are truncated after 9 letters, though (unless the Glulx setting is used) punctuation inside a word, such as an apostrophe, can make this happen earlier. The best way to avoid trouble is simply to use more easily distinguishable names. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c745" -->
<a id="c745"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Some polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate are chemicals in the Lab.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>works fine, because now only one chemical can be called TEREPHTHALATE, and that means they can be distinguished.</p>
<p>Finally: numbers up to twelve may be written out in words in the source text, but larger ones must be written as numerals. So &quot;twelve&quot; or &quot;12&quot;, but &quot;13&quot; only.</p>

<p>But a kind cannot change during play, so this will not do. Instead, the colour will have to be a property of the block. So we might first try this:</p>

<p>Which is fine, so far as it goes, but the colour property is not at all visible to the player, who simply sees &quot;eleven blocks&quot;. We thought of colour as being something outwardly apparent, but Inform does not know this. To achieve a better effect, we will need features from distant chapters. The first is an activity called &quot;printing the name of&quot;:</p>

<p>This too, however, is unsatisfactory. The individual blocks are correctly described, but we are unable to distinguish them during play: we cannot type &quot;take a green block&quot;, for instance. And because the blocks are indistinguishable in play, they are still massed together as &quot;eleven blocks&quot; in room descriptions. We need to go one step further:</p>
