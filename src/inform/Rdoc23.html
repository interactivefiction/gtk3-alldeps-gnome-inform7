<p>By default, Inform gives the player character (and every other person) a simple unitary body, one without hands or feet or any other defined parts. In many games this is adequate; but in others it is not enough, and we may want to endow all people with some more specific physical features, as in</p>

<p>Suppose we want to let the player explicitly sit, stand, or lie down on different enterable objects. (Normally Inform treats all these actions as entering, but there may be cases where we want to distinguish between the player sitting on a chair and the player standing on it.)</p>
<p>Our implementation gives each kind of enterable a range of allowed postures, and one preferred posture. If the player enters the supporter or container without specifying a posture (as in ENTER CHAIR), he will be put in the preferred posture. If he explicitly says, e.g., STAND ON CHAIR, he will be put in the standing position as long as standing is a posture that suits the chair.</p>

<p>Suppose that we're going to give every person in the game a nose, but we want references to a nose always to mean the nose of someone *else*, if the player is with one other person. Moreover, on some occasions we're going to be in sight of Rudolph, so actions directed at an unspecified nose should always prefer his.</p>
<p>This relies on a somewhat advanced technique from the Understanding chapter, but since it may become useful with assemblies and body parts, it is worth mentioning here.</p>
