<p class="sectionheading">ยง3.3. Position Within Rooms</p>
<p>Inform's division of geography into &quot;rooms&quot; is a good compromise for most purposes. The rooms are cut off from each other by (imaginary or actual) walls, while all of the interior of a given room is regarded as the same place.</p>
<p>Suppose we want things to happen differently in different corners of the same room? Inform can already do this a little, in that the player can be inside an enterable container or on an enterable supporter. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10008" -->
<a id="c10008"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of opening a door when the player is on the bed, say &quot;You can't reach the handle from the bed.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we need to have divided-up areas of the floor itself, the standard approach is to define a small number of named positions. We then need to remember at which of these locations the player (or something else) currently stands.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Further Reasons Why All Poets Are Liars</span> allows the player to be in different parts of a room by standing on a box which can be in different places: thus only the box needs an internal position, not the player, simplifying matters neatly.</p>
<p>Another interesting case is when one room is entirely inside another (such as a hut in a field, or a booth in a large convention hall), so that the exterior of the room should be visible from another location. <span class="boldface">Starry Void</span> gives a simple demonstration of a magician's booth that can be examined from the outside, opened and closed, and entered to reach a new location.</p>

<p>Sometimes we may want a room to be visible from the outside in one location, but treated as a separate location when we are inside.

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we've arranged for the booth to be described in the initial room description in different ways depending on where the player is when viewing it. We might like to do the same if the player takes a closer look:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10026_9" -->
<a id="c10026_9"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of examining the magician's booth in the Center Ring:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;It is dark blue and glittering with gold stars. [if the booth is open]The door currently stands open[otherwise]It has been firmly shut[end if].&quot;

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And now we put it in place:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10028_9" -->
<a id="c10028_9"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The magician's booth is inside from Center Ring and outside from Starry Void.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...and make sure that the booth-and-door object responds to all the names we have used for it in different places:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10029_9" -->
<a id="c10029_9"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;door&quot; or &quot;of&quot; or &quot;the&quot; or &quot;light&quot; or &quot;crack&quot; or &quot;thin crack&quot; as the booth.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c10030_9" -->
<a id="c10030_9"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test me with &quot;examine booth / open door of the booth / in / examine door / close door / look / examine crack of light&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A final nice touch, if we're so inclined, is to borrow from the Basic Actions chapter and make the player automatically open the booth door before trying to enter:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10031_9" -->
