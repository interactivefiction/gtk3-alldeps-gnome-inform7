<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.8. Saying Complicated Things</p>
<p>As we saw in the overview, there are challenges in choosing the commands with which the player will communicate to the story. Two common approaches are ASK/TELL conversation, where the player can ask or tell characters about keywords, as in ASK JILL ABOUT JACK or TELL FARMER ABOUT CHICKEN COOP, and menu-based conversation, where the player is offered a list of things to say and must pick one (often by number), as in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c12698" -->
<a id="c12698"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
1) Ask Jill where Jack went.
<br />2) Tell Jill that the chicken coop was robbed.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or, sometimes,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c12699" -->
<a id="c12699"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
1) &quot;Jill, have you seen your no-good layabout brother Jack anywhere?&quot;
<br />2) &quot;Look, Farmer Jill, I think a fox got into the chickens.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The problem with ASK/TELL conversation is that it can feel undirected - if the player doesn't know which keywords to ask or tell about next, he gets stuck. It also doesn't always provide much sense of ongoing context or conversational flow, since the player can ask lots of unrelated questions and jump around a lot. What's more, sometimes the thing the player character asks isn't quite the question the player had in mind. If we type ASK JILL ABOUT JACK, Jill could wind up answering any of a number of questions - where Jack is, how old Jack is, whether Jack committed the recent murder, and so on. The player doesn't have much fine control over the conversation. Nonetheless, this is sometimes just what we want: <span class="boldface">Farewell</span> implements a moderately sophisticated system along these lines, which keeps track of what the player has already said and allows him to review past conversation.</p>
<p>Menu-based conversation solves most of these problems: a branching tree of conversation choices maintains a consistent flow of discussion, it's hard for the player to run out of things to say, and the player always knows what his character is about to say. But there are compensating flaws. For one thing, a menu doesn't allow for many surprises. The player can see all the conversation the story has to offer by working methodically through all the menu branches. (This problem is sometimes referred to as the &quot;lawnmower effect&quot;, since the process of seeing all the conversation is like the process of running a lawnmower over every inch of the lawn. It becomes a chore rather than an entertainment.) Menu systems can be long-winded to set up and therefore none are exemplified here, but several have been released as extensions for Inform.</p>
<p>Since about 2001, more and more IF has used a sort of compromise method: the player is allowed to ask or tell about keywords, but he's sometimes given prompts about things to say that follow naturally on the conversation he was just having, as in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c12700" -->
<a id="c12700"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You could ask where Jack is.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Moreover, when he asks about a topic where many comments are possible, he'll be allowed to clarify, either using a menu or through a disambiguation question such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c12701" -->
<a id="c12701"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;ask Jill about Jack
<br />Do you want to ask where Jack is, how old Jack is, or whether Jack committed the recent murder?
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p><span class="boldface">Sweeney</span> implements one such hybrid type of conversation.</p>
<p>A third option is to take away almost all the player's expressiveness and give him just one command, TALK TO. The player can TALK TO characters whenever he wants, and the story will pick the most appropriate thing for him to talk about. This works best in works with few or simple puzzles and a fast-moving, constrained plot, where the player will keep having new things to talk about. <span class="boldface">Cheese-makers</span> demonstrates this.</p>
<p>Finally, a few extreme games try to fake natural language understanding by looking for keywords in the player's input, rather than an exact grammar. This is perilous, because it is all too easy for the story to completely misunderstand what the player meant to type. Nonetheless, for the sake of example, see <span class="boldface">Complimentary Peanuts</span>, in which the incomprehension is partly excused by the fact that the player is talking to someone a bit hard of hearing.</p>

<p>As we have seen, there are a number of different ways of controlling conversation in interactive fiction, and the best choice of way will depend quite a lot on what kind of work we're writing.</p>
<p>One common model is to replace Inform's default ASK and TELL commands with a TALK TO command. This gives the player less control than he would otherwise have: instead of asking a character about any topic under the sun, he's restricted to seeing (or not seeing) a single sequence of text that the author has written in advance. On the other hand, such a system is harder for the player to break (since he can never ask about a topic that the author hasn't implemented), and easier for the author to tie into plot developments. If we give TALK TO different output at each scene, we get conversation that is always tied to the current state of the plot.</p>
<p>This is a design approach that works best in a game with a large number of short, focused scenes. For other kinds of conversation system design, compare the other examples listed in the Recipe Book.</p>

<br />&quot;With a fart and a roar, Heracles asks the world at large, and you in particular, where his dinner might be.&quot;
<br />&quot;In epic diction, Heracles invites the dairy-mistresses, whey-matrons, and concubines of curd to supply him a supper from their ample baskets.&quot;
<br />&quot;Heracles and the chorus banter about the proclivities of cheese-wives. The chorus suggest that Heracles, as a son of Zeus, must know something about the appetites of which they speak.&quot;
<br />&quot;Heracles boasts that a man like himself can perform any feat, but only when his belly is full. Coyly, the matrons prance and dance, skip and gambol out of his grasp, singing mockingly about heads of garlic and loaves of sesame-crusted bread.&quot;
<br />&quot;The song of the feta fanciers now turns to pots of honey and new-made wine, borrowing verses from last year's Lenaia winner, 'The Bees'. With a jolt, you realize that you've missed your cue and the chorus are filling in for you.&quot;
<br />&quot;Playing for time, the chorus-leader elaborates a whole banquet: rabbit stew, shanks of lamb, spitted quails, eels from lake Copais. Heracles looks as near swooning as any girl fresh from Brauron.&quot;
<br />&quot;The chorus-leader extends the list of delicacies to include ox-brains, ham-hocks, barley, mullet, carrots, pigeons, lentils, radishes, peas, and apples both wine-dark and golden. The audience shifts on the benches. An expression of gloom settles over the Priest of Dionysus in the front row.&quot;
<br />&quot;Inspired by Euripides['] own Muse, the chorus-leader invents a mock-Alcaean hymn on the merits of chervil. This is clearly his swan-song: if you don't speak at last, the play will come to a halt.&quot;
