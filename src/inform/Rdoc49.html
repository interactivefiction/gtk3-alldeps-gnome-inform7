<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.3. Reactive Characters</p>
<p>As we observe characters, so they observe us. Those who seem to have no awareness of what the player is doing often come across more like waxworks than like people. <span class="boldface">Zodiac</span> demonstrates a scenario where the watchful presence of a dangerous criminal keeps the player from doing what he otherwise might, while <span class="boldface">Police State</span> expands on this idea with a policeman who reacts to entire types of behavior in his presence, regardless of whether the culprit is the player or a third party. <span class="boldface">Noisemaking</span> has a crow who will fly away in response to any loud noises the player makes.</p>
<p>And, of course, we definitely want to have characters react to being looked at or otherwise interfered with. <span class="boldface">Search and Seizure</span> implements a smuggler who reacts when we try to confiscate his possessions. <span class="boldface">Pine 1</span> gives us a sleeping princess who can be woken by a variety of methods.</p>
<p>We wrap up this section with two complete puzzle scenarios that demonstrate what can be achieved by giving characters reactions to the player's behavior. <span class="boldface">A Day For Fresh Sushi</span> has a fish who watches the player's actions and comments on them, while the live furnishings in <span class="boldface">Revenge of the Fussy Table</span> instead comment every turn on the current state of the world, until the player has successfully sorted out all their complaints.</p>

Singing too will be deemed too risky in the presence of our sinister foe. But we do need to make an exception for &quot;look&quot;, or else we won't get even the room description.</p>

<p>Because scene rules are checked every turn, they can be useful for designing puzzles which have multiple solutions. Instead of deciding the puzzle is &quot;solved&quot; when the player does a certain action, we set up a scene that checks to see whether the player has achieved a certain outcome -- however he accomplished it.</p>

<p>Notice the difference between the two rules about disorderly conduct: the one for other people says 'the rule succeeds' to make sure that the action is counted as a success and not (as normally happens with instead rules) a failure. Most of the time we don't care whether actions are judged successes or failures, but it matters here, because if we type CHARLES, JUMP and the result fails, then text such as 'Charles is unable to.' will be printed - which would get in the way. So we declare the action a success.</p>

<p>Suppose the current sequence of action handling is not quite enough for us: we'd also like to have a stage after reporting, where other characters can react to the player character's behavior after it has already happened and been reported on screen. Having such a stage is unlike using &quot;after&quot;, because after occurs before reports and prevents them from being printed. So, for instance, we could allow the player to do any of a range of different actions that make loud noises, and have a nervous bird that reacts to all of them by flying away afterward.</p>
<p>To do this, we can add a new rule into the specific action-processing rules. (For a list of these, see the Rules index.) Moving rules around and adding new ones requires syntax that we will learn in the chapter on Rulebooks, but the present example is fairly straightforward:</p>

<p>The following is an almost-completely-faithful rewrite of Emily Short's &quot;A Day for Fresh Sushi&quot;, which was originally written using the (very different) Inform 6 programming language. The -- let us be honest and call it a gimmick -- of this game is the evil fish, who has some unpleasant remark to offer on pretty much every action. But the effect would wear off fast if he repeated himself, so these comments need to be single-use only.</p>
<p>Inform 7's repeated action syntax makes it much tidier to write the same scenario, so:</p>

[=0x0022=][if visited]Decorated with Britney[=0x0027=]s signature flair. It was her innate sense of style that first made you forgive her that ludicrous name. And here it is displayed to the fullest: deep-hued drapes on the walls, the windows flung open with their stunning view of old Vienna, the faint smell of coffee that clings to everything. Her easel stands over by the windows, where the light is brightest.[otherwise]This is Britney[=0x0027=]s studio. You haven[=0x0027=]t been around here for a while, because of how busy you[=0x0027=]ve been with work, and she[=0x0027=]s made a few changes -- the aquarium in the corner, for instance. But it still brings back a certain emotional sweetness from the days when you had just met for the first time... when you used to spend hours on the sofa...[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]You shake your head. No time for fantasy. Must feed fish.[end if][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of smelling the Studio:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]The evil fish notices you sniffing the air.

Understand [=0x0022=]portrait[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]image[=0x0022=] as the painting.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the painting is [=0x0022=]Only partway finished, but you can tell what it is: Britney[=0x0027=]s mother. You only met the old woman once, before she faded out of existence in a little hospice in Salzburg.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]In the picture, her hands are grasping tightly at a small grey bottle, the pills to which she became addicted in her old age, and strange, gargoyle-like forms clutch at her arms and whisper in her ears.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]But the disturbing thing, the truly awful thing, is the small figure of Britney herself, down in the corner, unmistakable: she is walking away. Her back turned.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]You thought she[=0x0027=]d finally talked this out, but evidently not. Still feels guilty for leaving. You only barely stop yourself from tracing, with your finger, those tiny slumped shoulders...[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of taking the painting, say [=0x0022=]No, you[=0x0027=]d better leave it. It[=0x0027=]d freak her out if you moved it.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Before examining the painting for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]A ferocious banging from the aquarium attracts your attention as you go to look at the painting. [=0x0027=]Hey![=0x0027=] screams the fish. [=0x0027=]She doesn[=0x0027=]t like strangers looking at her paintings before they[=0x0027=]re DOONNNE![=0x0027=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]Shut up, you,[=0x0027=] you reply casually. [=0x0027=]I[=0x0027=]m not a stranger.[=0x0027=] But the fish puts you off a little bit, and your heart is already in your mouth before you see the painting itself...[=0x0022=].[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of examining the painting more than once:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]Once is really enough. It[=0x0027=]s pretty much embedded in your consciousness now.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After doing something to the painting:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]So what[=0x0027=]s it of?[=0x0027=] asks the fish, as you turn away. [=0x0027=]She never asks if I want to see them, you know?[=0x0027=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]Her mother,[=0x0027=] you respond without thinking.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]Yeah? Man.

It is openable and closed. Understand [=0x0022=]windows[=0x0022=] as the window. The description of the window is [=0x0022=][if open]Through the windows you get a lovely view of the street outside. At the moment, the glass is thrown open, and a light breeze is blowing through.[otherwise]Through the windows, you get a lovely view of the street outside -- the little fountain on the corner, the slightly dilapidated but nonetheless magnificent Jugendstil architecture of the facing building. The glass itself is shut, however.[end if][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After opening the window for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Thank god some air,[=0x0027=] says the fish. [=0x0027=]Man, it was getting hard to breathe in here.[=0x0027=] Two beats pass. [=0x0027=]Oh wait.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The table is scenery in the Studio. On the table is a vase. The vase is an open container. It is not openable.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the table is [=0x0022=]A monstrosity of poor taste and bad design: made of some heavy, French-empire sort of wood, with a single pillar for a central leg, carved in the image of Poseidon surrounded by nymphs. It[=0x0027=]s all scaley, and whenever you sit down, the trident has a tendency to stab you in the knee. But Britney assures you it[=0x0027=]s worth a fortune.[=0x0022=] The description of the vase is [=0x0022=]A huge vase -- what you saw once described in a Regency romance as an epergne, maybe -- something so big that it would block someone sitting at the table from seeing anyone else also sitting at the table.
