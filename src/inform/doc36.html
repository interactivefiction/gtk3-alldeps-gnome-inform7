<p class="sectionheading">ยง3.11. Two descriptions of things</p>
<p>The player's first sight of something is the text used as its &quot;initial appearance&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c242" -->
<a id="c242"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The plain ring is here. &quot;Cast aside, as if worthless, is a plain brass ring.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This text appears as a separate paragraph in the text describing the Painted Room. It will continue to be used until the first time player picks the ring up (if this ever happens), so it normally describes things in their original, undisturbed context. (Inform uses an either/or property called &quot;handled&quot; for this: something is &quot;handled&quot; if it has at some point been held by the player.)</p>
<p>Thus when a piece of text stands alone as a sentence in its own right, then this is either the &quot;description&quot; of the most recently discussed room, or the &quot;initial appearance&quot; of the most recently discussed thing. Either way, it is used verbatim as a paragraph in the text shown to the player visiting the room in question.</p>
<p>But a thing also has an ordinary &quot;description&quot;, which is used to give a close-up look at it. This text is ordinarily only revealed to the player when a command like &quot;examine ring&quot; is keyed in:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c243" -->
<a id="c243"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<div class="egpanel" id="example186" style="display: none;">
<p>Occasionally it is useful to give something a printed name because we want to call it something extremely long-winded; give one thing a name that is the subset of the name of something else; or use words such as &quot;with&quot; or &quot;and&quot; that are likely to confuse Inform into thinking that the object name ends before it actually does.</p>
<p>Often it is enough to preface these ambiguously-titled things with &quot;a thing called...&quot; or &quot;a supporter called...&quot; or the like, as here:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c257_186" -->
<a id="c257_186"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
South of Spring Rolls is a room called Hot and Sour Soup.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>prevents Inform from trying to read &quot;Hot and Sour Soup&quot; as two separate rooms, while</p>
<!-- START CODE "c258_186" -->
<a id="c258_186"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player carries an orange ticket. The player carries a thing called an orange.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>creates two objects instead of the one orange ticket that would result if the second sentence were merely &quot;The player carries an orange.&quot;</p>
<p>Really long names can be a bit cumbersome. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c259_186" -->
<a id="c259_186"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player carries a thing called an incriminating photograph of a woman with blonde hair.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So we might instead give the photograph a printed name:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c260_186" -->
<a id="c260_186"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('[=0x0022=]Laura[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The City of Angels is a room. The incriminating photograph is carried by the player.

Thus [=0x0022=]Understand [=0x0022=]blonde hair[=0x0022=] as the photograph[=0x0022=] would require that both [=0x0022=]blonde[=0x0022=] and [=0x0022=]hair[=0x0022=] be present, and would not recognize [=0x003E=]X BLONDE, [=0x003E=]X HAIR BLONDE, or [=0x003E=]X HAIR.][=0x000A=][=0x000A=][Second, we can create tokens, such as [=0x0022=]Understand [=0x0022=]blonde hair[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]hair[=0x0022=] as [=0x0022=][hair][=0x0022=], and then use these tokens in match phrases. This saves a good deal of time when we want to specify a number of different but fussy alternatives. So, for instance, here is a drawing that would not respond to [=0x003E=]X OF, or [=0x003E=]X BROWN EYES, but would respond to [=0x003E=]X DRAWING OF MAN WITH BROWN EYES, [=0x003E=]X MAN WITH BROWN EYES, and so on:][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The drawing is carried by the player.

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we've gotten around any awkwardness with printing the name -- but we also need to understand when the player refers to the photograph. When we define the names of objects under normal circumstances, Inform takes care of this automatically, but if we have especially set the printed name, we must also specially define the appropriate terms for the player to use. For this we need &quot;understand&quot;, which will be explained in much more depth in a later chapter:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c262_186" -->
<a id="c262_186"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;with&quot; or &quot;blonde&quot; or &quot;hair&quot; or &quot;of&quot; or &quot;a&quot; as the incriminating photograph.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c263_186" -->
<a id="c263_186"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test one with &quot;x photograph / x incriminating photograph of a woman with blonde hair / x hair / x blonde / x woman with blonde hair / x incriminating photograph of a woman&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That's probably as far as we really need to go, and if you are satisfied with this behavior, there is no need to read on.</p>
<p>One possible objection to this solution is that Inform will accept some nonsensical formulations as applying to the photograph: for instance, it will allow &gt;EXAMINE PHOTOGRAPH OF, &gt;X BLONDE PHOTOGRAPH WOMAN INCRIMINATING, or even &gt;X OF ...though in the case there were two items with &quot;of&quot; names, the game would disambiguate with a question such as &quot;Which do you mean, the incriminating photograph of a woman with blonde hair or the essence of wormwood?&quot;</p>
<p>Traditionally, Inform has tended to be fairly flexible about word order, preferring to err in the direction of leniency. On the other hand, there are times when we need more exacting rules in order to distinguish otherwise similar cases.</p>
<p>Two features allow us to specify more exactly if we so desire. The first is that, if we specify a whole phrase as the name of something, all the words in that phrase are required, in the order given. Thus &quot;Understand &quot;blonde hair&quot; as the photograph&quot; would require that both &quot;blonde&quot; and &quot;hair&quot; be present, and would not recognize &gt;X BLONDE, &gt;X HAIR BLONDE, or &gt;X HAIR.</p>
<p>Second, we can create tokens, such as &quot;Understand &quot;blonde hair&quot; or &quot;hair&quot; as &quot;[hair]&quot;, and then use these tokens in match phrases. This saves a good deal of time when we want to specify a number of different but fussy alternatives. So, for instance, here is a drawing that would not respond to &gt;X OF, or &gt;X BROWN EYES, but would respond to &gt;X DRAWING OF MAN WITH BROWN EYES, &gt;X MAN WITH BROWN EYES, and so on:</p>

<p>...the player will not be able to refer to it as &quot;purple&quot; or &quot;rabbit&quot; or &quot;purple rabbit&quot;.</p>
<p>There are also ways to make names to refer to entire kinds of objects (so &quot;dude&quot; will refer to any man in the game); to specify names that only refer to objects in the plural (so GET PICTURES will pick up several pictures together); to reflect an object's properties (so &quot;red apple&quot; works only as long as the apple is in fact red); or even to refer to the object's relationships to other objects (so &quot;bottle of wine&quot; works only when wine is indeed in the bottle). All these refinements are discussed in the chapter on Understanding.</p>
