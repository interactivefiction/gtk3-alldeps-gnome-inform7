<p class="sectionheading">ยง19.13. Rulebooks producing values</p>
<p>We have now seen two ways to write the outcome of a rule: as simple success or failure, with more or less explicit phrases like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7938" -->
<a id="c7938"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
rule succeeds;
<br />rule fails;
<br />continue the action;
<br />stop the action;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and by using a named outcome for the current rulebook as if it were a phrase, as in:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7939" -->
<a id="c7939"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
low background noise;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>There is still a third way: we can stop a rule and at the same time produce a value. This isn't needed very often - none of the built-in rulebooks in the Standard Rules produces a value.</p>
<p>As we've seen, every rulebook has one kind of value as its basis, and it also has another kind of value for it to produce. If we call these K and L, then we have altogether four ways to write down the kind of a rulebook:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7940" -->
<a id="c7940"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
rulebook
<br />K based rulebook
<br />rulebook producing L
<br />K based rulebook producing L
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we don't mention K, Inform assumes the rulebook is action based. If we don't mention L, Inform assumes L is &quot;nothing&quot;, that is, Inform assumes no value is ever produced. Thus</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7941" -->
<a id="c7941"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Drum summons rules is a rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7942" -->
<a id="c7942"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Drum summons rules is an action based rulebook producing nothing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But let's now look at a rulebook which does produce something.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7943" -->
<a id="c7943"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The cat behavior rules is a rulebook producing an object.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This rulebook works out which thing the cat will destroy next. We might have rules like this one:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7944" -->
<a id="c7944"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Cat behavior when Austin can see the ball of wool:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;rule succeeds with result the ball of wool.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The value is produced only when a rule succeeds, using this phrase:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn281" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn281"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>rule succeeds with result </b>(value)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_succeedswith -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in a rule which produces a value, and the value given must be of the right kind. It causes the current rule to finish immediately, to succeed, and to produce the value given.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>How are we to use the cat behavior rulebook? If we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7945" -->
<a id="c7945"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
follow cat behavior
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the rulebook runs just as any other rulebook would, but the value produced is lost at the end, which defeats the point. Instead, we might write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7946" -->
<a id="c7946"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let the destroyed object be the object produced by the cat behavior rules;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the destroyed object is not nothing:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Austin pounces on [the destroyed object] in a flurry.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the destroyed object is nowhere.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The key phrase here is</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7947" -->
<a id="c7947"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
object produced by the cat behavior rules
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which accesses the value this rulebook produces. In general, we write:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn282" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn282"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(name of kind)<b> produced by </b>(rule producing values)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_producedby -->

<p>This phrase is used to follow the named rule, and to collect the resulting value.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn283" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn283"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(name of kind)<b> produced by </b>(values based rule producing values)<b> for </b>(value)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_producedbyfor -->

<p>This phrase is used to follow the named rule based on the value given, and to collect the resulting value.</p>

<!-- end definition -->

<p>Suppose we have a cat which is supposed to react to (and destroy) the most interesting thing in its environment. There are several ways we could approach this problem, but for the sake of demonstration, let's have it follow a rulebook to figure out which thing it most wants to interact with. We will then return the chosen object as &quot;the object produced by the cat behavior rules&quot;.</p>

<p>In our previous implementations of playing cards, we've gotten as far as creating decks of individual cards that the player can draw and discard. But in a poker game, one doesn't just have a collection of cards: one has a hand of a specific kind.</p>
<p>Here we take on the job of writing an inventory listing for a poker hand that will reflect the real value of what the player has drawn. To do this, we create a rulebook to sort and assess the cards in the player's hand; its possible return values are limited to the kinds of poker hands that exist, from &quot;high card&quot; to &quot;royal flush&quot;.</p>
<p>The first three sections, creating the deck of cards and the means to parse their names, are identical to those we've already seen in Tilt 1; new material begins at section 4.</p>
<p>For the purposes of demonstration, we're simulating something akin to five-card draw without wilds; stud or hold-em variations would add some other complexities.</p>

Here we will start by assessing our hand to determine these qualities:][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The hand-ranking rules is a rulebook.

It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on [=0x0022=]Looking at containment by hand[=0x0022=] in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player[=0x0027=]s hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player[=0x0027=]s hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]A card can be sorted or unsorted.

<p>The ranking of poker hands traditionally depends on three features: 1) whether all the cards are of the same suit (flush); 2) whether the cards constitute a numerical run of ranks (straight); and 3) how many cards or sets of cards are of matching rank (pairs, three of a kind, and four of a kind). Here we will start by assessing our hand to determine these qualities:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>For convenience in identifying hand features, and for elegance when we print the hand-listing, we start by sorting the cards in the player's hand so that the high-ranked cards are listed first. It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on &quot;Looking at containment by hand&quot; in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player's hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player's hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.</p>

<p>This last printing instruction is there for diagnostic purposes: later we'll add a testing command to turn debugging on and off; when it's on, the game will print out its card list at various stages in sorting, to help us trouble-shoot any problems. In normal play, however, this will be off.</p>
<p>Next up, a check to see whether the player has a flush:</p>

<p>Now we check for straights; this is slightly complicated by the fact that an ace can be either the bottom of a low straight (lower than 2) or the top of a high straight (higher than king), so we explicitly check both possibilities.</p>

<p>And finally, we need to identify any groups of cards of the same rank. We want to know how many groups there are and how large each group is (though in practice there can only be one group of three or four in a standard-sized poker hand). We also want to mark any grouped cards so that we can move them to the front of the player's hand when we take inventory.</p>

<p>Next we tweak our sorting to reflect the make-up of the hand. There are two reasons why this might differ from the straight highest-to-lowest sort we did earlier:</p>
<p>1) we want to list aces as high unless they are serving as the bottom of a low straight, in which case they should appear last;</p>
<p>2) we want combinations to appear at the front of the list, sorted from highest value to lowest value: larger combinations first, then smaller combinations, and combinations of equal size sorted by rank.</p>

<p>The somewhat rough-and-ready principle of this table is that we will overwrite the cards in the player's hand by resetting their ranks and suits; every five rows of the table represent a new poker hand for the game to attempt to sort and identify. These include one example of each of the major kinds of poker hand, plus a couple of variations involving aces which test the special sorting rules.</p>
