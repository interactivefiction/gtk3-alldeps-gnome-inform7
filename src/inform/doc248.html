<p>If we want to know the atomic number of Uranium, say, it seems artificial to have to talk about the particular row number where the information happens to be. So we are also allowed to cross-reference, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5042" -->
<a id="c5042"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the atomic number corresponding to a symbol of &quot;Fe&quot; in the Table of Selected Elements
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This results in 26, and similarly</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5043" -->
<a id="c5043"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the symbol corresponding to an atomic number of 26 in the Table of Selected Elements
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>results in &quot;Fe&quot;. But we have to be careful:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5044" -->
<a id="c5044"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the element corresponding to an atomic number of 27 in the Table of Selected Elements
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is not allowed (it produces an error at run-time), because there is no row with atomic number 27 in this rather limited table. We can check this in advance with the condition:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5045" -->
<a id="c5045"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if there is an element corresponding to an atomic number of 27 in the Table of Standard Elements ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or more simply:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5046" -->
<a id="c5046"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if there is an atomic number of 27 in the Table of Standard Elements ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The condition &quot;if there is...&quot; can be used with any reference to a table entry: for instance, &quot;if there is a symbol in row 5 of the Table of Standard Elements&quot; would be false, because there are only four rows.</p>

<p>The problem of implementing an elevator that opens onto a large number of floors often challenges novice interactive fiction authors. It also raises a fundamental design problem -- how to implement a large building in an interesting way. It is tempting to write a hotel with an elevator and innumerable tedious and identical floors just for the sake of realism; in many cases it is a better idea simply to omit any locations that contribute nothing to the story or the play of the game.</p>
<p>In charity, though, let us assume that the author has a legitimate reason for wanting to implement an elevator that opens onto some generic floors. We will go whole-hog, and set this in the world's tallest hotel: Burj al-Arab, Dubai.</p>

<p>This will all work very well, unless the player has portable objects; in that case, anything he drops on the Generic Floor will be there every time he goes back -- whether it's masquerading as Floor 6 or Floor 23. There are there are two ways round this -- (i) the cheeky way. When we drop something, the unobtrusive yet ever-vigilant maids pick it up and take it down to the Foyer's lost property office; and (ii) the super-duper way, in which things are moved out of play but with their floor numbers remembered, so that the scenario can be reconstructed each time. (i) is probably in fact the more true-to-life, considering the hotel's boasts about its service, but we will demonstrate both methods.</p>
