<p class="sectionheading">ยง4.8. New value properties</p>
<p>So much for either/or properties. Now we move on to properties which have values attached. The same principles apply, but the wording is different. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c623" -->
<a id="c623"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A dead end has some text called the river sound. The river sound of a dead end is usually &quot;a faint whispering of running water&quot;. The Tortuous Alcove has river sound &quot;a gurgle of running water&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The property &quot;river sound&quot; is now applicable only to dead ends, so we would not be allowed to talk about &quot;the river sound of the Savannah&quot;, say. Moreover, it's required to hold a piece of text. If we tried the following:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c624" -->
<a id="c624"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The river sound of the Tortuous Alcove is 7.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...then Inform would object, because the number 7 is the wrong kind of value to go into the &quot;river sound&quot; property. If we need a numerical property, we can try this instead:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c625" -->
<a id="c625"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A dead end has a number called the difficulty rating. The Tortuous Alcove has difficulty rating 7.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Suppose that we were to add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c626" -->
<a id="c626"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Exquisitely Narrow Defile is a dead end.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The Defile must have a river sound, of course, because we said that every dead end would have one. We haven't said what that river sound will be, but Inform can work it out, because we did say this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c627" -->
<a id="c627"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The river sound of a dead end is usually &quot;a faint whispering of running water&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If there are no instructions at all about the value of a property, Inform fills in the default value of the appropriate kind - in this case, it would be a blank text. (A table of the kinds which can be used for properties, and their default values, can be found in the Kinds index.)</p>

<p>Sometimes we like to give properties to kinds of thing, but not fill them in in all cases. For instance, we might have vehicles that optionally make noise, and those might have a &quot;movement sound&quot;.</p>
