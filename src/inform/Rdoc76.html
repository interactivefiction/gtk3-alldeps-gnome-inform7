<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.9. Televisions and Radios</p>
<p>IF authors often provide clues or background information to the player by means of radio broadcasts, TV shows or video tapes because they can talk to the player without needing to listen back, or to react to what the player does. The simplest radio set, like the one in <span class="boldface">Aftershock</span>, really only has one thing to say: which is serendipitously being broadcast just at the moment the player tunes in (regardless of when that is). The next simplest approach is to spool a broadcast on an endless loop taking several turns to play through, as in <span class="boldface">Radio Daze</span>.</p>
<p>Televisions come in all shapes and sizes, and <span class="boldface">Aspect</span> allows their shape (&quot;aspect ratio&quot;) to be described by the player.</p>
<p>In <span class="boldface">Channel 1</span>, we can also refer to the television by what it is currently showing: thus WATCH CHANNEL 4 will work if the set is indeed tuned to 4. In <span class="boldface">Channel 2</span>, numbered channel changing is taken further: we can now TUNE TV TO CHANNEL 3, as well. <span class="boldface">Channel 2</span> is a reasonable base implementation of a television for many purposes.</p>

<p>where no television is specified. When we are designing commands which involve two elements (here, a television and a channel number), it's usually a good idea to allow the player to specify those elements in either order, as we saw demonstrated briefly in &quot;New commands for old grammar&quot;.</p>
<p>We might, therefore, want to add a few refinements: first by defining a &quot;[channel]&quot; token that will accept input of the forms &quot;[number]&quot; and &quot;channel [number]&quot;, and second by creating some additional &quot;Understand&quot; lines that will accept variant versions of the player's input.</p>

<p>The built-in behavior of Inform is to print a line after a device is examined, saying whether the item is on or off. This is often inappropriate, and we could simply turn off that behavior in general by instructing Inform to ignore the &quot;examine described devices rule&quot; (see the chapter on rulebooks).</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, we would like continue to have a short passage about the action of any switched on device; we'd just like a little more control over what it says from time to time. And in that case, we might change the rule to give a new activity control over that portion of the description:</p>
