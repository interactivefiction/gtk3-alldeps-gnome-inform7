<p class="sectionheading">ยง21.3. Saying lists of values</p>
<p>Any list L can be said, provided that its contents can be said. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8347" -->
<a id="c8347"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let L1 be {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
<br />say L1;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces the text &quot;2, 3, 5, 7 and 11&quot; - unless we have &quot;Use serial comma.&quot; set, in which case a comma appears after the 7. We also have the option of using the more formal notation:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn324" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn324"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[</b>(list of values)<b> in brace notation]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_listbraced -->

<p>This text substitution produces the list in the form of &quot;{&quot;, then a comma-separated list, and then &quot;}&quot;, which looks less like an English sentence but more mathematical. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8348" -->
<a id="c8348"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[list of people in brace notation]&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>might produce &quot;{ yourself, Mr Darcy, Flashman }&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>If we say a list of lists, then the individual entry lists are always printed in brace notation: the ordinary sentence way would be incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Of course, the values in L1 are written out in number form because L1 is a list of numbers: we could alternatively try</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8349" -->
<a id="c8349"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let L2 be {the piano, the music stand};
<br />say L2;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which produces &quot;piano and music stand&quot;. Lists of objects can be said in two additional ways:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn325" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn325"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[</b>(list of objects)<b> with definite articles]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_listdef -->

<p>This text substitution writes out the list in sentence form, adding the appropriate definite articles. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8350" -->
<a id="c8350"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let L be {the piano, the music stand};
<br />say &quot;[L with definite articles]&quot;;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>says &quot;the piano and the music stand&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn326" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn326"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[</b>(list of objects)<b> with indefinite articles]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_listindef -->

<p>This text substitution writes out the list in sentence form, adding the appropriate indefinite articles. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8351" -->
<a id="c8351"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let L be {the piano, the music stand};
<br />say &quot;[L with definite articles]&quot;;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>says &quot;a piano and a music stand&quot;.</p>

<p>As we've seen in earlier examples such as &quot;Equipment List&quot;, it is possible to vary the way Inform creates inventory listings in general (to create lists that look more like paragraphs of prose, lists divided between what the player is wearing and what he isn't, and so on). We can also use activities to alter the printing of specific objects' names and contents, as with the &quot;omit contents in listing&quot; feature after printing the name of something.</p>
<p>We may find, however, that we would like a great deal more control over Inform's printing of inventory details, not just as a special effect for a few items, but throughout the game.</p>
<p>We start by turning off Inform's native property writer:</p>

<p>Now the flashlight (and any other regular light sources we might add to the game) will be described as &quot;providing light&quot;, but the sack will only be said to be gently glowing -- a bit more appropriate for its rather fainter gleam.</p>
<p>We might also wish to add a systematic feature across the board to include a new property in the inventory list? Let's say the player can enchant his possessions, and enchanted possessions should thereafter be listed accordingly:</p>

<p>Further variations are possible as well: if we used a &quot;before printing the name...&quot; rather than an &quot;after printing the name...&quot; rule, we could automatically generate lines like &quot;an open and empty phosphorescent plastic sack&quot;, removing some of the artificiality of the parentheses.</p>
<p>Or we could add more logic to the rules about which properties are mentioned, so that some features of objects were mentioned in inventory only if the player was wearing the correct detection device, like so:</p>
