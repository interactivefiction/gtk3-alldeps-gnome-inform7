<p>Talking about characters presents some special challenges. For one thing, some characters are referred to by a proper name, but others are not: so the story might want to talk about &quot;Jack&quot; but also about &quot;the drunk pedestrian&quot;. In the absence of other information, Inform attempts to divine our intentions based on the words with which we defined a new character: but we can always override its guess with an explicit statement, such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c12165" -->
<a id="c12165"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Great Malefactor is proper-named.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p><span class="boldface">Belfry</span> demonstrates further how titles are set at the start of play.</p>
<p>The relation between the player and the other characters is not always static, however. Sometimes we want the player to learn a character's name part-way through play, and start referring to &quot;the drunk pedestrian&quot; as &quot;Fernando&quot;. Similarly, the status of another character may change due to some twist of the plot. <span class="boldface">Gopher-wood</span> shows how to change the name of a character mid-story, and <span class="boldface">Peers</span> handles changing the character's rank.</p>
<p>Alternatively, of course, the player character may already know some of the other characters when the story begins, even if the player does not. In that case, we may want to add a tag-line or so of identification to a character's name when he first appears in the story. <span class="boldface">A Humble Wayside Flower</span> shows one way of doing this.</p>
<p>Another occasional challenge is dealing with such commands as EXAMINE DR. THISBY. The problem here is that Inform by default will understand the full stop after &quot;Dr&quot; to be the end of one command and the beginning of another, and will try to interpret &quot;Thisby&quot; as a verb. If we do have a story populated by such formally-addressed characters, we may turn to Punctuation Removal, which provides a phrase to remove the full stops in standard titles before attempting to interpret the command.</p>
<p>Other characters have physical characteristics as well as names, of course, and <span class="boldface">Meet Market</span> demonstrates one way of implementing people with notable features.</p>
<p>Finally, in some IF, the roles of characters may change from playing to playing. If we are writing a replayable murder mystery, we might want to select a new culprit each time the story starts; for this, see <span class="boldface">Clueless</span>.</p>
