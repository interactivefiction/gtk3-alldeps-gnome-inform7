<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.3. Overriding existing commands</p>
<p>Suppose we are devising specialist commands for a game of whist, and we want &quot;discard&quot; as one of them. Looking at the table of commands in the Action index, we find that, inconveniently enough, &quot;discard&quot; already has a meaning: it is synonymous with &quot;drop&quot;, and while that might be sensible most of the time, it is perfectly wrong now. We need a way to free up &quot;discard&quot; for our own use. We can do that by:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5585" -->
<a id="c5585"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the command &quot;discard&quot; as something new.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This cuts it loose, so to speak, and ready to be given new meanings. If we check the Actions index again, we find no mention of &quot;discard&quot; - it is now a blank slate - but &quot;drop&quot; is still exactly as it was. We could now say something like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5586" -->
<a id="c5586"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;discard [something]&quot; as discarding.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(If we had declared that &quot;drop&quot; was something new, the whole thing would have happened in reverse, with &quot;discard&quot; retaining all of the original grammar. Inform does not distinguish between a command and its synonym.)</p>
<p>The &quot;... as something new&quot; sentence works even for a command which did not exist anyway, for instance with:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5587" -->
<a id="c5587"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the command &quot;zylqix&quot; as something new.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Of course this does nothing - but it is intentional that it generates no problem messages: it means that the sentence can be used to force a command to be fresh and untouched by previous definitions, which might be useful when working with extensions by other people.</p>
<p>It is also possible to clear out all the commands leading to a given action:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5588" -->
<a id="c5588"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand nothing as taking.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The commands &quot;take&quot; and &quot;get&quot; will still exist, but now they'll only have their other senses (for taking off clothes, for getting out of boxes).</p>

<p>Back in the chapter on randomization, we explored a way to create a randomized combat system. That system didn't allow for multiple weapons, though. Here we explore how to create an ATTACK IT WITH action that will let the player choose between weapons with different maximum powers.</p>
<p>We're also going to rewrite that original &quot;instead of attacking:&quot; rule into an attacking it with action that can be performed equally by the player or by any of the player's enemies.</p>

Section 4 - Attacking it with
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In our new system, we want to specify what is being used for an attack. This means that we need to create a new &quot;attacking it with&quot; action, and also that we should disable the existing &quot;attacking...&quot; command.</p>
<p>Here's why: If we leave the default attack command in place, Inform will continue to accept commands like &gt;ATTACK GLADIATOR, but reply foolishly with the default &quot;Violence is not the answer...&quot; response.</p>
<p>A somewhat better approach would be to change the reply of &gt;ATTACK GLADIATOR to say something like &quot;You must specify a weapon to attack with.&quot; But this is still less than ideal, because it means that the player has to then rewrite his entire command. If, on the other hand, we take out &quot;ATTACK GLADIATOR&quot; entirely, the game will always prompt &quot;What do you want to attack the gladiator with?&quot; -- which teaches the player the correct command structure for this particular game, and avoids pretending to understand any command that is not meaningful within this game.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of work because ATTACK has a lot of synonyms in the default library, but if we look through the actions index we can find them all:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5611_317" -->
<a id="c5611_317"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the commands &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;thump&quot; and &quot;break&quot; and &quot;smash&quot; and &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;wreck&quot; as something new.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we make our new command:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5612_317" -->
<a id="c5612_317"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Attacking it with is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing. Understand &quot;attack [someone] with [something preferably held]&quot; as attacking it with.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that we've specified &quot;one carried thing&quot;, because we want the player to pick up a weapon to use if necessary. And now we assign all the old attack vocabulary to apply to the new command:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5613_317" -->
<a id="c5613_317"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the commands &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;thump&quot; and &quot;break&quot; and &quot;smash&quot; and &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;wreck&quot; as &quot;attack&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This may seem counter-intuitive, but order of source code matters here: we first get rid of the old, default vocabulary, then define our new action, then make the vocabulary apply to that new action. Inform will now understand &gt;HIT GLADIATOR WITH TRIDENT, &gt;BREAK GLADIATOR WITH TRIDENT, and so on.</p>
<p>Our new action is also a perfect place to use an action variable: we're going to need to choose an amount of damage done and refer to that several times in our action rules. So let's set that up first:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5614_317" -->
