<p>&quot;Disenchantment Bay&quot; is a simple work of IF used as a running example in Chapter 3 of <span class="italic">Writing with Inform</span> - not so much a tutorial as a convenient hook on which to hang some demonstrations of the basics. Because the resulting examples only use basic features and in the most straightforward way, they make for uninteresting &quot;recipes&quot; - so they are not included in the <span class="italic">Recipe Book</span> proper. But some readers might like to have all twelve stages of the example gathered on a single page: this is that page.</p>

<p>The door and the view will need to be done as well, but they are special cases which we will get to shortly.</p>
<p>As noted, making something scenery also means that the player will be prevented from picking it up and carrying it away. This is sensible, though: if an object can be removed from the room where it first appears, we should be careful about mentioning it in the main room description; otherwise, it will continue to be described as present even when someone has carried it off.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that the captain wouldn't let just anyone meddle with his fishing equipment; maybe he keeps that case locked. We could replace the case description with this one, instead:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c9330_390" -->

<p>Now there's a silver key that will unlock it -- though since we haven't said where the key is, the player will never be able to find it in the game. (If we look at the World index, we find &quot;small silver key&quot; right at the bottom, not inside any of the rooms.

<p>This capacity system makes a compromise between the realistic and the absurd: on the one hand, it acknowledges that people can't carry an infinite number of items in their hands, while at the same time providing a sack that can.</p>
