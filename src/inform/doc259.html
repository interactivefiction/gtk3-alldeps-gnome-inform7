<p>The first time we record &quot;gluttony&quot; as achieved, 2 points will be awarded and the time will be logged in the Table, but on all subsequent occasions nothing will happen. So the combination of the phrase and the Table will look after a scoring system based on achieving specific goals (probably not the seven deadly sins, of course).

<p>And... at that point you're a lot less close to being done than you think. The filling -- onions, sage, apricot, and cheese -- must be assembled and put in the chicken breasts; these tied up in string; each roll dipped in egg yolk and rolled in panko crumbs; these arranged in the Calphalon pan and baked. Then later, the whole retrieved from the oven, and the breasts transferred to a plate while we deglaze the pan and concoct the sauce with the chicken broth, wine, butter, etc. Then the chicken is sliced and plated, and the sauce poured over top. Usually one also wants a side dish or two. A number of things can go interestingly wrong in this process, of course, and implementing it would require, among other things, an intelligent management of all the possible mixtures that result.</p>
