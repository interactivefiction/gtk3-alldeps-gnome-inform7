<p>Text can also be saved to a file, and again all file-handling is automatic:</p>

<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_writetext -->

<p>This phrase makes the given text become the entire contents of the named file. Note that files must have been declared, and must be referred to by their Inform names, not by textual filenames. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8801" -->
<a id="c8801"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
write &quot;Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.&quot; to the file of Abecedary Wisdom;

<div class="definition"><a id="defn373"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>append </b>(text)<b> to </b>(external file)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_appendtext -->

<p>This phrase adds the given text to the end of the current contents of the named file (creating it if it does not exist on disc). Note that files must have been declared, and must be referred to by their Inform names, not by textual filenames. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8802" -->
<a id="c8802"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
append &quot;Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt.&quot; to the file of Abecedary Wisdom;

<!-- END CODE -->

</div>

<p>The quoted text can, of course, contain substitutions, so can be long and complex if need be.</p>
<p>Text from a file is printed back with the text substitution:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn374" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn374"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[text of </b>(external file)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_saytext -->

<p>This text expands to the contents of the named file. Note that files must have been declared, and must be referred to by their Inform names, not by textual filenames. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8803" -->
<a id="c8803"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[text of the File of Abecedary Wisdom]&quot;

<!-- START CODE "c8804" -->

<p>Some mystery games supply the player with an in-game system for taking notes, in case he doesn't want to rely on scraps of paper next to the computer. One way of doing this is to write out all the player's notes and observations into a notebook file, whose contents can be retrieved during play (or, indeed, after it).</p>
<p>We'll first invent a general system for writing text into notebooks, by creating a new kind called jotter. Each individual jotter will have its own disc file, and there will be basically three things which can be done with jotters: erasing, reading and writing.</p>
