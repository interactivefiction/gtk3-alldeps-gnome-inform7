<p>Occasionally we would like to change the way the name of something is printed as part of our inventory, and we can do this with a printing the name rule such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11547" -->
<a id="c11547"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of the dead rat while taking inventory:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;dead rat (at arm's length)&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>There are also several possibilities for redesigning the inventory list as a whole. <span class="boldface">Persephone</span> shows how to divide an inventory list into two parts, a &quot;You are carrying: &quot; section and a &quot;You are wearing: &quot; section. <span class="boldface">Equipment List</span> goes further, and shows how we might use Inform's specialized listing functions to create a variety of differently formatted inventories.</p>
<p>Sometimes the way Inform by default lists properties such as &quot;(closed)&quot; or &quot;(open but empty)&quot; isn't quite what we want. <span class="boldface">Oyster Wide Shut</span> offers a flexible alternative to the standard behavior, allowing finer control over which properties are listed and how they are described.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Trying Taking Manhattan</span> replaces the inventory behavior for other characters: instead of silently looking through their possessions (but not describing them to the player), they now describe to the player what they're carrying and wearing.</p>

<p>As we've seen in earlier examples such as &quot;Equipment List&quot;, it is possible to vary the way Inform creates inventory listings in general (to create lists that look more like paragraphs of prose, lists divided between what the player is wearing and what he isn't, and so on). We can also use activities to alter the printing of specific objects' names and contents, as with the &quot;omit contents in listing&quot; feature after printing the name of something.</p>
<p>We may find, however, that we would like a great deal more control over Inform's printing of inventory details, not just as a special effect for a few items, but throughout the game.</p>
<p>We start by turning off Inform's native property writer:</p>

<p>Further variations are possible as well: if we used a &quot;before printing the name...&quot; rather than an &quot;after printing the name...&quot; rule, we could automatically generate lines like &quot;an open and empty phosphorescent plastic sack&quot;, removing some of the artificiality of the parentheses.</p>
<p>Or we could add more logic to the rules about which properties are mentioned, so that some features of objects were mentioned in inventory only if the player was wearing the correct detection device, like so:</p>

<p>Most of the phrase options above are relatively self-explanatory; a few are less so. Here is an overview:</p>
<p>&quot;With newlines&quot; tells Inform to put a new line before each listed object. Indented tells it to indent contents of objects, when listing these.</p>
<p>&quot;Giving inventory information&quot; means to append information such as (closed) or (being worn) to objects.</p>
<p>&quot;As a sentence&quot; means to put &quot;and&quot; before the last object and commas between them; this is usually not used in conjunction with newline listing. &quot;As a sentence&quot; obeys whatever conventions about the use of the serial comma we may have established with the &quot;Use serial comma&quot; option.</p>
<p>&quot;Including contents&quot; means to list the contents of open or transparent containers and all supporters, whereas including all contents means to list the contents of all containers, even opaque closed ones.</p>
<p>&quot;Tersely&quot;, perhaps unexpectedly, puts parentheses around objects listed as the contents of other objects.</p>
<p>&quot;Giving brief inventory information&quot; omits most of the inventory tags, such as &quot;(open)&quot; and &quot;(worn)&quot;, but does list &quot;(closed)&quot; for closed containers which might not otherwise be obviously openable.</p>
<p>&quot;Using the definite article&quot; means prefixing objects with &quot;the&quot;, if applicable, rather than &quot;a&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Listing marked items only&quot; means including only objects that have already been declared &quot;marked for listing&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Prefacing with is-are&quot; means that Inform will write &quot;is&quot; before the list if it contains only one item, and &quot;are&quot; if the list contains more than one.</p>
<p>&quot;Not listing concealed items&quot; means to omit from the list anything which is scenery.</p>
<p>Finally, &quot;with extra indentation&quot; means that the whole list should be indented slightly, in emulation of the default inventory listing.</p>
<p>With this information, we can try rewriting the inventory behavior to emulate the standard or to explore alternate versions:</p>
