<p>Lastly we can also ask for a more specific number of possibilities, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1266" -->
<a id="c1266"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if two women are carrying animals
<br />if at most three doors are open
<br />if fewer than 10 portable containers are closed
<br />if all but two of the devices are switched on
<br />if there are more than six locked doors
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Likewise for &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;at least&quot;, &quot;all except&quot;. Something to watch out for is that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1267" -->
<a id="c1267"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if two doors are open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be found true if there are (say) three open doors: after all, if three doors are open, then certainly two doors are. So this is not quite counting. We can be more precise by writing</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1268" -->
<a id="c1268"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if exactly two doors are open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;all but&quot; counts - say, &quot;if all but two doors are open&quot; - are exact: if, in fact, all of the doors are open then this will be found false.</p>
<p>We can often use these counting forms with values, too. As with the use of &quot;all&quot;, this is allowed only if the kind of value is one which can reasonably be searched through. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1269" -->
<a id="c1269"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if more than three scenes are happening
<br />if there are more than two non-recurring scenes
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are allowed because the built-in kind of value &quot;scene&quot; (of which much more later on) has only a small number of possible values.</p>
<p>Lastly, note that the &quot;the&quot; in text like &quot;two of the doors&quot; matters: without it, the phrase will not be recognised as a requirement on the number. (This is to make sure that names of things like &quot;two of hearts&quot; are not misinterpreted.)</p>

The glass presentation case is transparent scenery in the Library. The description is &quot;The case is taller than you are, framed in wood, with large panels of glass, the better to display the remarkable contents.&quot;

Instead of attacking the glass presentation case:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;The glass pane of the presentation case shatters, throwing fine glass everywhere, including over the delicate museum-piece inside. Nor does the noise pass unnoted: only a second passes before there are footsteps in the hall, and though you make for the concealing darkness and escape of the turret, you are not swift enough. The servants are soon on you, and you are made to regret, quite painfully, this casual act of vandalism.&quot;;

The strange dress is a wearable thing in the glass case. The description is &quot;Not the sort of dress that anyone wears now: such elaboration would be ludicrous.  It drips gold -- gilt lace, ruffles of trimmed gold, shimmering golden tracery -- dulled here and there by the sinister black of faceted jet.&quot;
