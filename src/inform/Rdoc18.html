<p class="sectionheading">ยง4.2. Scripted Scenes</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to arrange a scene in which something goes on in the background (as though it were a movie playing) while the player goes about his business; or where a series of things has to happen before the player gets to the end.</p>
<p>The simplest way to arrange background events for a scene is to write the sequence of events into a table and work our way through it, printing one line per turn, until the scene runs out. <span class="boldface">Day One</span> does exactly this.</p>
<p>At other times, we want a scene to last as long as it takes the <span class="italic">player</span> to do something. <span class="boldface">Entrapment</span> lets the player poke around and explore as much as he likes, but ends as soon as he has accomplished the scene's goal - which, unfortunately for him, is to get into an embarrassing situation so that another character can walk in and make fun of him. <span class="boldface">The Prague Job</span> has a scene that requires the player to do a more specific set of tasks, but nags him and hurries him along until he's done.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Bowler Hats and Baby Geese</span> assumes that our story is going to be assembled with a number of scenes, some of which will need to prevent the player from leaving the location until the scene is complete: it thus defines a &quot;restricted&quot; property for scenes, so that all such elements of the plot will work in the same way.</p>
<p>For more complex sorts of scripts and schedules, it may be worth consulting the extensions.</p>

<p>The power of scenes lies in their ability to watch for general conditions and move the narrative along whenever these are fulfilled. Instead of waiting for the player to do one specific thing, the game waits for the world to be in a certain condition, before moving to the next stage of the plot.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we have a story in which the player has been captured for doing something inappropriate at court and is brought in to await a meeting with a palace official. We want to give the player a few minutes to stew, and we want the scene to end with him doing something mildly peculiar or embarrassing, and the official catching him in the act. So we tempt him into trying any of a number of different kooky activities, and just wait until he falls into the trap...</p>

One way to set this up is to create a property for such scenes -- let's call them &quot;restricted&quot; -- and then write a rule that keeps the player in place while the scene happens:</p>
