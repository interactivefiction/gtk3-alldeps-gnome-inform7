<p>The &quot;device&quot; kind provides for the simplest form of machine: one which is, at any given moment, switched on or switched off. Inform looks after this state, but leaves it to us to make the machine actually do something:</p>

<p>One primary dictionary definition for a machine is &quot;an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts&quot;, and we often use the &quot;part of&quot; relationship to build machinery. <span class="boldface">Control Center</span> provides a neat way to display the component parts of a machine to the player who examines it.</p>
<p>One component almost always part of an electrical machine is the (literal) switch, lever or button to control whether it is switched on or off. In <span class="boldface">Model Shop</span> just such an on/off button is automatically made part of every device.</p>
<p>While an electrical device has only two states, a mechanical machine might have many, and for these the best approach is to define a kind of value naming the possibilities: see <span class="boldface">Signs and Portents</span>, where the states are the possible destinations pointed towards.</p>
<p>Perhaps stretching the definition of &quot;machine&quot;, <span class="boldface">What Makes You Tick</span> demonstrates a fishing pole which the player can put together from several pieces.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to let the player build a fishing pole out of three parts: a hook, a string, and a stick.</p>
<p>There are several things we must account for here. One is that our combination verb should be insensitive to ordering: it shouldn't matter whether the player types COMBINE STICK WITH STRING or COMBINE STRING WITH STICK.</p>
<p>Second, we need to make sure that our implementation handles intervening stages of assembly gracefully. The player should be able to combine string and hook first, or string and stick first, and be able to complete the assembly in either case.</p>
<p>Our implementation here uses a table of lists to determine which combinations of inputs should produce which result object. Because we sort our lists before comparing them, we guarantee that the player's ordering doesn't matter: COMBINE STICK WITH STRING will have the same effect as COMBINE STRING WITH STICK.</p>
<p>What's more, our implementation could be expanded to account for many other assemblages, if we wanted object-building to be a running theme of puzzles in our game.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And now the game will have a model train's button and a toy elephant's button.</p>
<p>It may be that we want (as an added nuance) to add other names for these items. While we would want an assembly to create objects such as &quot;Lucy's hand&quot; and not &quot;Lucy hand&quot;, it is entirely reasonable to want to talk about the model train button or the elephant button. We could define these additional names like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c14715_130" -->
<a id="c14715_130"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;elephant button&quot; or &quot;button on elephant&quot; as the elephant's button.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c14716_130" -->
<a id="c14716_130"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;model train&quot; or &quot;model&quot; or &quot;train&quot; as &quot;[train]&quot;. Understand &quot;[train] button&quot; or  &quot;button on [train]&quot; as the model train's button.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In the second case, we are defining [train] to mean any of the three phrases &quot;train&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, and &quot;model train&quot;; so &quot;[train] button&quot; will match &quot;model train button&quot; or &quot;train button&quot; or &quot;model button&quot; equally well. See the chapter on Understanding for more on how to create alternative phrasings for the player to use.</p>
