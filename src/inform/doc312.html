<p class="sectionheading">ยง18.26. Printing the locale description of something</p>
<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> A &quot;locale description&quot; is Inform jargon for the part of a room description which catalogues the visible items in the room. When looking, Inform will normally print the description of the room itself, followed by a locale description for the room. But if the player is in a cage in the room, there will be two locale descriptions: one for the room, then another for the cage. This activity is used to write the locale description for a single domain, and the &quot;something&quot; can be either a room, an enterable container, or an enterable supporter.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> Is quite complicated, and is written up in full in the typeset form of the Standard Rules downloadable from the Inform website. Briefly, though: we first run the &quot;choosing notable locale objects&quot; activity to find out what ought to be mentioned here. That assembles a list of things to mention, sorted into priority order. Items with priority 1 go first, then those with priority 2, and so on. The &quot;printing a locale paragraph&quot; activity is run for each, and in practice that usually hands the job over to &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot;. Sometimes a paragraph will indeed be written, but not always. Sometimes there is nothing interesting to say, and an item is left until a final, single paragraph which gathers up the leftovers (&quot;You can also see a scarlet fish, a harmonium and a kite here.&quot;), the printing of which is done by the &quot;listing nondescript items of&quot; activity. As soon as any item picks up the either/or property &quot;mentioned&quot;, by having its name printed, it is struck out so that it will not appear subsequently, whatever its priority.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> As general advice: if the effect wanted can be got using &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot; and &quot;listing nondescript items of&quot; alone, use those; if it's necessary to meddle further, use &quot;choosing notable locale objects&quot; and &quot;printing a locale paragraph&quot; to alter the normal processes; use the all-powerful &quot;printing the locale description&quot; activity only when the whole process needs to be altered, not the item-by-item workings.</p>
<p>(a) In the Very Misty Moorlands, nothing on the ground can ordinarily be seen through the swirling mist, so the locale description is suppressed entirely:</p>

<p>When it comes time to start manipulating the priorities of items, it is useful to be able to check the table for debugging purposes; the problem is that printing the names of the objects can itself affect the way the room description is generated, foiling our debugging efforts.</p>
<p>What follows is a rule to help with debugging safely, and a sample of how priorities work:</p>

<p>It may also be useful to know about the &quot;parameter-object&quot;, which refers to the thing whose contents we are currently describing: the standard rules consider how to describe the contents of the location and then also check the contents of any supporter or container the player may be inside, so in the first case &quot;parameter-object&quot; would be the location, and then in the second the supporter in question.</p>
<p>In practice this is rarely useful, but should we need to change priorities in the case of both player and object being inside a particular container, we might make use of it, for instance:</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that by default that final collection of generic objects (&quot;You can also see...&quot;) appears at the end, regardless of the priority of everything else.

<br />Rule for writing a paragraph about an icky thing (called icky item) which is on something which supports the player: say &quot;Ew, [an icky item] is right next to you.&quot;

<p>This procedure also means (as you can test by experiment) that after the late edition has been picked up and dropped again, it lists in no special order in the &quot;you can see...&quot; paragraph (since initial appearances only print when the object has not yet been moved).</p>
