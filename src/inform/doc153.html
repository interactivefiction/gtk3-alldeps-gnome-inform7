<p class="sectionheading">ยง10.4. During scenes</p>
<p>Scenes are not only useful for changing the setting, by moving items or people around and providing a little narration. We can also make the rules different in one scene from another. For instance, at a sleepy country halt there is no reason why one should not walk across the tracks: but if there is a train in the way, that would be impossible.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2423" -->
<a id="c2423"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going north during the Train Stop, say &quot;The train blocks your way.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Any rule can have the clause &quot;during ...&quot; attached, provided that clause goes at the end and either explicitly names a scene, or gives a description of which scenes would match. This is especially useful with &quot;every turn&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2424" -->
<a id="c2424"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn during the Train Stop, say &quot;Water is sluiced out of the tank and into the engine.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can test whether a scene is happening with the adjective &quot;happening&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2425" -->
<a id="c2425"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Train Stop is happening, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START PHRASE "defn115" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn115"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has happened:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hashappened -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has both begun and ended.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn116" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn116"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has not happened:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasnothappened -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has not ended (or never started).</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn117" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn117"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has ended:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasended -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene ended at least once.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn118" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn118"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has not ended:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasnotended -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has never ended.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We need to be a bit careful: it's possible to set things up so that the Train Stop scene will play out more than once, so &quot;Train Stop is happening&quot; and &quot;Train Stop has happened&quot; might both be true at once.</p>
<p>The kind of value &quot;scene&quot; is one which is allowed to have properties - it has a tick in the &quot;properties&quot; column in the chart in the Kinds index - and this can be very useful in describing scenes. For instance, we could write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2426" -->
<a id="c2426"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A scene can be thrilling or dull. Train Stop is dull.
<br />A scene has a text called cue speech. The cue speech of Train Stop is &quot;All aboard!&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform has the adjectives &quot;recurring&quot;, &quot;non-recurring&quot; and &quot;happening&quot; all built in to describe scenes, and the above would add &quot;thrilling&quot; and &quot;dull&quot;. Moreover, the &quot;during&quot; clause of a rule can give a description of a scene as easily as a specific scene name. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2427" -->
<a id="c2427"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going north during a dull non-recurring scene, ...
</p></blockquote>

<p>American radio adventure series of the 1950s were unobtrusively sponsored by breakfast cereals, as the following modest example demonstrates. Note that the scene-changing for the commercial break needs to know nothing about the actual programme it breaks into: if Part I were replaced with a different Space Patrol episode, Part II need not be changed at all.</p>

<p>Scenes can have properties -- a fact that is very useful when it comes to writing a series of scenes that all need to act alike in some respect.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a plot that features a number of scripted scenes, where we need the player to stand still and wait while the events of the scene play out. One way to set this up is to create a property for such scenes -- let's call them &quot;restricted&quot; -- and then write a rule that keeps the player in place while the scene happens:</p>
