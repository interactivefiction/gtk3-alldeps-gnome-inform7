<p class="sectionheading">ยง3.4. Continuous Spaces and The Outdoors</p>
<p>Suppose we want to blur the boundaries between rooms, in an environment where there are no walls: out of doors, for instance?</p>
<p>The simplest cases involve making something exceptional visible in more than one place. <span class="boldface">Carnivale</span> features an exceptionally large landmark seen by day; <span class="boldface">Eddystone</span> an exceptionally bright one by night. <span class="boldface">Waterworld</span> allows a very distant object (the Sun) to be seen throughout many rooms, but never approached. <span class="boldface">View of Green Hills</span> gives the player an explicit command for looking through into an adjacent room.</p>
<p>Three systematic examples then present outdoor landscapes with increasing sophistication. <span class="boldface">Tiny Garden</span> gives the multiple rooms of an extended lawn descriptions which automatically adapt to say which directions lead into further lawn area. <span class="boldface">Rock Garden</span> provides a relation, &quot;connected with&quot;, between rooms, allowing items in one to be seen from the other: an attempt to interact with a visible item in a different area of the garden triggers an implicit going action first. <span class="boldface">Stately Gardens</span> provides a much larger outdoor area, where larger landmarks are visible from further away, and room descriptions are highly adaptive.</p>
<p>In an outdoor environment, the distinction between a one-move journey and a multiple-move journey is also blurred. <span class="boldface">Hotel Stechelberg</span> shows a signpost which treats these equally.</p>

<p>This produces acceptable output again, but there is a more elegant way, one that works better with Inform's existing world model. Currently the default model assumes that accessibility -- whether the player can reach something or not -- is checked between the Before... rules and the Instead... rules. We can add our own accessibility rules, including this one to govern whether views are accessible. So for instance:</p>

<p>A map of linked rooms works well for modeling enclosed or indoor space, and somewhat less well for modeling large open spaces, where a person should reasonably be able to see things which are much too far away to touch. With some modifications to scoping, though, we can create an environment where objects in nearby rooms are described and viewable, and where the player will automatically move towards distant items before interacting with them physically.</p>
