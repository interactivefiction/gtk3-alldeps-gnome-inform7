<p>Here's the tricky part, which relies on material from the chapters on Activities and Rulebooks:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13656_366" -->
<a id="c13656_366"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The container interior rule is listed before the room description body text rule in the carry out looking rules.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we've done that, we can write a &quot;rule for describing the interior&quot; of something, which will print whatever we like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13659_366" -->
<a id="c13659_366"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;The hover-bubble is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In fact, as a special refinement, we could even say:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13660_366" -->
<a id="c13660_366"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
