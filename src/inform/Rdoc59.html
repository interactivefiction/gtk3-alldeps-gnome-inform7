<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.13. Traveling Characters</p>
<p>There are a number of ways we can make characters navigate our map. We might reasonably want them to approach and follow the player (as in <span class="boldface">Van Helsing</span>); or to allow the player to follow characters who have left the room (as in <span class="boldface">Actaeon</span>).</p>
<p>Characters who are less interested in the player will more likely follow their own courses around the available geography, however. A character may move randomly from room to room, as demonstrated in <span class="boldface">Mistress of Animals</span>; he may follow a path that we have specifically written in advance, as <span class="boldface">Odyssey</span> shows; or, most elegantly, he may use the &quot;best route&quot; calculation to find the best possible way to a given target room, as seen in <span class="boldface">Latris Theon</span>.</p>
<p>This final method is arguably the neatest solution to character movement, allowing for characters to act in sophisticated ways; if we incorporate the Locksmith extension, other characters will even unlock and open doors that are in their way. The chief catch is that it should not be used too profligately with large numbers of characters, since on slow machines the processing power required to plan all their travel will make a noticeable difference to the running speed of the story.</p>
<p>All the same, the constraints are not so severe as to preclude having a moderate number of route-finding characters all wandering around at once. This does introduce a new problem, however: movement descriptions can become hard to follow if every turn produces long reams of reports such as</p>

<p>Suppose we want to write a character who tries to be in the same room as the player. We will do this by testing every turn whether the character's location and the player's location are the same; if the answer is no, the character will look for a path to the player's location, then try to move along that path. (We will learn more about finding paths and giving characters instructions later.)</p>
<p>The result will be that if the player ever moves to another location, the character will automatically pursue him.</p>

<p>Now we try something a bit unusual. Inform on its own will report each action on its own line, so that each character who walks into or out of a room will be described in a separate paragraph. This is usually fine, but in a game with a lot of characters moving around simultaneously, it can become a bit overwhelming. Instead, we may want to condense these reports into a single line, such as &quot;Ben and Jerry enter from the south&quot;. The following accomplishes that goal by replacing some of the reporting rules, storing the information in a table, and then reading the table back later, once all the character movement has been resolved and the reports can usefully be collated:</p>

<p>Because so much of this game is randomized, it will not be possible to provide a test command that systematically solves it. A good strategy is to go to Main Street, get the syringe; go to the Town Hall and get the key; then visit the shops, inject everyone, and lock them in when they've all been injected. Then go to the Pool Hall, turn on the air conditioner, and wait for the remaining parties to show up.</p>
<p>This is also something that could get fairly slow if we added many more rooms and characters to it. In that case, we might want to select fast route-finding so that character movement won't take as long. This will cost memory, possibly forcing the game into Glulx format if it isn't already, but significantly reduce the run-time for large maps with numerous people moving each turn:</p>
