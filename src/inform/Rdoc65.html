<p class="sectionheading">ยง8.3. Animals</p>
<p>Animals exhibit a wide range of behaviour: much of the chapter on Other Characters applies just as well to animals as to human beings, with the exception of the material on conversation. But two examples here, both fairly simple, show how a fairly convincing domestic pet can be achieved simply by reacting to certain events going on nearby: <span class="boldface">Feline Behavior</span> (a cat) and <span class="boldface">Today Tomorrow</span> (a dog).</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Fido</span> provides a dog which the player can re-name at will.</p>
<p>For animals that we can sit on and ride - a camel or a horse, say - we may want to use the Rideable Vehicles extension by Graham Nelson, which also provides a rideable animal kind.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a cat which is supposed to react to (and destroy) the most interesting thing in its environment. There are several ways we could approach this problem, but for the sake of demonstration, let's have it follow a rulebook to figure out which thing it most wants to interact with. We will then return the chosen object as &quot;the object produced by the cat behavior rules&quot;.</p>
