<p class="sectionheading">ยง16.16. Defining things with tables</p>
<p>Suppose we need to create a collection of items which differ in their properties, but are basically part of a larger pattern. For instance, here we set up what we need to make a collection of coloured shirts:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5414" -->
<a id="c5414"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A jersey is a kind of thing. A jersey is wearable. A jersey has a number called year established. A jersey has a text called citation. The description of a jersey is &quot;Since [year established], the Tour de France has awarded this jersey to the [citation].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we have the pattern, but making the actual shirts is tedious and repetitive:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5415" -->
<a id="c5415"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The yellow jersey is a jersey. The year established of the yellow jersey is 1919. The citation of the yellow jersey is &quot;race leader&quot;. The polkadot jersey...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And so on. Instead, we can use a table to abbreviate all of this:</p>

<p>The first column provides names for the new things to be created. Subsequent columns provide property values. Note that we did not need to say that jerseys have a number called &quot;year established&quot; because Inform is able to infer this from the column heading and the presence of numbers in the column; similarly for &quot;citation&quot;. Lastly, note that if any entry is blank (written &quot;--&quot;) then that particular property is simply not set for that particular item.</p>
<p>Note that Inform reads articles such as &quot;the&quot; or &quot;a&quot; in the first column just as it would when something is created with any other sentence.</p>
<p>It's even possible to define kinds this way, though it's rare to need to create many kinds at once. (See the worked example &quot;Reliques of Tolti-Aph&quot; at the Inform website. There's no special syntax needed: rather than saying &quot;Some jerseys are defined by...&quot; we would say &quot;Some kinds of jersey are defined by...&quot;)</p>
