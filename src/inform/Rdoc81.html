<p class="sectionheading">ยง10.2. Liquids</p>
<p>Liquids are notoriously difficult to simulate well. A fully thorough approach consumes endless storage and can be very finicky to write and keep realistic. It is essential to decide what aspect of a liquid's behaviour is actually needed in a given story, and to simulate only that. For instance, if we only need a little chemistry, where a player can add (say) water to salt and make a solution, we do not want to fool around with calculating quantities or concentrations: what's important is that &quot;some water&quot; (amount unspecified) combines with &quot;some salt&quot; to produce &quot;some salty water&quot;. We should no more calculate precisely here than we would work out where all the furniture is to the nearest inch. Good advice for handling liquids is to simulate the least amount of realism possible, but no less.</p>
<p>Sometimes all we want is a down-in-one drink: we needn't simulate the actual liquid, just the bottle it comes in, and all we need is to handle the &quot;drinking&quot; action. See <span class="boldface">Beverage Service</span>, and also <span class="boldface">3 AM</span>, where carbonated drinks can be shaken - again simulating the vessel, not the liquid.</p>
<p>Some elementary biochemistry in <span class="boldface">Xylan</span> is done simply by... well, the point is that two different liquids are represented by single things each, and a chemical reaction simply switches one for the other.</p>
<p>In <span class="boldface">Frizz</span>, we allow any container to be filled with water (only) and we simulate what happens to any solid objects also inside: some waterproof, some not. <span class="boldface">Flotation</span> provides a well (always full of water), with rules to determine whether things dropped into it should sink or float.</p>
<p>Next we move up to quantitative approaches, where we remember not just whether a liquid is present, but how much of it. In its simplest form, we could have a drinking vessel from which we draw in sips, so that it can be full, half-empty or empty: see <span class="boldface">Thirst</span>.</p>
<p>The example with the best compromise between simulation quality and complexity is <span class="boldface">Lemonade</span>. Here we provide a kind of container called a &quot;fluid container&quot;, not just a single cup, and each such vessel has a given &quot;fluid capacity&quot;. Each holds only a single liquid at a time (so no mixtures) and can be empty or full to any level (rounded off to the nearest 0.1 fl oz). We can fill one vessel from another (unless it would make a mixture). But liquids leaving these vessels must be consumed - drunk or poured away without trace: we cannot make pools on the floor, or carry liquids in our cupped hands. There is no object representing &quot;lemonade&quot;: there are only fluid containers, but which can be called LEMONADE if that is what they now contain.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Savannah</span> is a light elaboration of Lemonade, showing how liquids might be poured on other objects, as for instance to extinguish a fire.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Noisy Cricket</span> extends <span class="boldface">Lemonade</span> to allow for mixing, though then the number of different possible mixtures is so large that complexity increases greatly. <span class="boldface">Lakeside Living</span> extends <span class="boldface">Lemonade</span> differently to add a &quot;liquid source&quot; kind, a form of fluid container which has infinite fluid capacity and is scenery - ideal for a lake, river or spring.</p>

<p>Of course, how our players will ever solve this problem is another question (especially if their biology and chemistry are both rusty). When adding entirely new commands to a game, it is often a good idea to provide as many ways of phrasing the command as possible; to drop hints about the correct phrasing within the game's text; or even to tell the player about the expanded command list in some documentation or help at the beginning of the game.

<!-- START CODE "c15141_47" -->

Understand &quot;break down [something] with water&quot; or &quot;break [something] down with water&quot; as hydrolyzing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And these lines will also provide syntax for our new command, without interfering with the previous syntax. It's also good to anticipate alternative (British or American) spellings.

<!-- START CODE "c15142_47" -->
<a id="c15142_47"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;hydrolyse [something]&quot; as hydrolyzing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Then some text in-game might offer a clue, subtle or (since this is an example) blunt:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c15143_47" -->
<a id="c15143_47"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

Understand &quot;break down [something]&quot; or &quot;break [something] down&quot; as hydrolyzing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And finally, we could try adding instructions explicitly:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c15145_47" -->
<a id="c15145_47"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;help&quot; or &quot;hint&quot; or &quot;hints&quot; or &quot;instructions&quot; or &quot;info&quot; or &quot;about&quot; as asking for help. Asking for help is an action out of world. Carry out asking for help: say &quot;The following commands are understood, in addition to the standard ones: EVAPORATE, FREEZE, HYDROLYZE, SUBLIME...&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c15146_47" -->
<a id="c15146_47"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test more with &quot;help / x me / break down xylan&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...though of course in fact these other commands won't be available until we define them, too.</p>
<p>This last approach, defining all the extra commands up front, is especially useful if these commands are very technical or unusual; if they are needed early in the game, before you've a chance to educate the player; or if they are not suggested by any in-game objects. A player who encounters a tool with an obvious use, such as a hairbrush, will likely think of trying to BRUSH things with it. It's harder to rely on his guessing actions that are both outside the range of usual commands and unrelated to any of the visible props, however.</p>

<p>Liquids, and all substances that can be mixed or broken off in partial amounts, pose a challenge to model in interactive fiction. The following example is a simple one, but adequate for many scenarios.</p>
<p>We start by assuming that all liquids in the game will always appear in containers. The player can pour liquids from one container to another, and the containers keep track of how full they are and describe themselves appropriately. The player can also refer to containers by content.</p>
<p>Mixture, however, is not allowed, nor is it possible to put liquids on other objects, pour them out on the ground, etc. These ideas would require a more complicated set-up.</p>

<p>Of course, the merging of fire and liquids also raises the possibility of gasoline and explosives, of heating and boiling liquids, etc.: as always, it's wise to incorporate a simulation that is only as detailed as the game's interactions really justify.</p>

<p>Our previous experiments into liquid have not dealt with the possibility of mixing components, but that is because for most games, tracking the details of mixture is overkill.</p>
<p>But let's suppose that this time we do want to have mixed liquids; moreover, we want a way to describe the mixtures to the player inventively, so that if he hits specific combinations those combinations are recognized: calling the result a martini, say, rather than just &quot;a mixture of vodka and vermouth&quot;.</p>
<p>The implementation that follows relies on a fairly simple idea from linear algebra. Any given liquid can be expressed as a vector in N-space, where N is the number of available ingredients and the length of the vector depends on how much of each ingredient is used; then we find the recipe that best describes the liquid by taking the dot product of our liquid vector with a bunch of sample vectors and selecting the one with the largest result.</p>
<p>If this does not make sense, don't worry: it's not necessary to understand the idea to use the code.</p>
<p>Any implementation involving a large number of place values is always a bit challenging in integer arithmetic. This examples assumes that no bodies of liquid will ever be very large, and that the proportions of ingredients in a mixture will not be vastly askew. (No 20-parts-to-1 proportions, for instance.) This probably works reasonably well for the cocktails that we make the basis of the example.</p>

<p>And now we add our liquid source kind, which will represent lakes, absinthe fountains, and any other infinite supplies of liquid we might need. Note that 3276.7 is the largest possible number of fluid ounces available to us.</p>

A liquid source is a kind of fluid container. A liquid source has a liquid. A liquid source is usually scenery. The fluid capacity of a liquid source is usually 3276.7 fl oz.

<p>We want filling things from liquid sources to work the same way as usual, with the distinction that a) the liquid source never depletes in quantity (hence the carry-out rule resetting its fullness); and b) we should report the results a bit differently as well:</p>

<p>On the other hand, pouring liquids into a liquid source needs to work completely differently from pouring liquids into anything else. Let's say we're going to allow any liquid at all to be dumped into rivers and streams (environmental protections evidently are not very well-enforced in this scenario):</p>
