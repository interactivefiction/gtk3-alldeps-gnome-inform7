<p class="sectionheading">ยง13.9. Defining new assertion verbs</p>
<p>Here is an example definition of a new verb:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3921" -->
<a id="c3921"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to sport means the wearing relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Once this is done, we can write the assertion</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3922" -->
<a id="c3922"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mr Wickham sports a Tory rosette.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which will do the the same thing as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3923" -->
<a id="c3923"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mr Wickham wears a Tory rosette.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because both verbs have the same relation as their meaning.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of Inform needed to be told how to make other parts of the verb, but that's rarely true now. Just writing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3924" -->
<a id="c3924"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to sport means the wearing relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is enough for Inform to understand &quot;he sports&quot;, &quot;they sport&quot;, &quot;he sported&quot;, &quot;it is sported&quot;, &quot;he is sporting&quot;, &quot;he had sported&quot; and so on. It works with irregular verbs, too; it has a very comprehensive dictionary. But it's legal to spell out the conjugation if need be:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3925" -->
<a id="c3925"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to sport (he sports, they sport, he sported, it is sported) implies the knowledge relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Occasionally it's convenient to have the relation the other way around. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3926" -->
<a id="c3926"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to grace means the reversed wearing relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>With that defined, these two sentences have identical meanings:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3927" -->
<a id="c3927"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mr Wickham sports a Tory rosette.
<br />A Tory rosette graces Mr Wickham.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Reversed in this sense means that the things related - the subject and object of the verb - are the other way round.</p>
<p>The Phrasebook index contains all the verbs associated with assertions, in the Verbs section. When we add new verbs to our source, those will appear in the Phrasebook as well.</p>
<p>The verbs above (&quot;to grace&quot;, &quot;to sport&quot;) are short ones, but we're free to make them longer than that. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3928" -->
<a id="c3928"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to cover oneself with means the wearing relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c3929" -->
<a id="c3929"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Peter is covering himself with a tent-like raincoat.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we have &quot;to cover oneself with&quot;, four words long; the limit is 29.</p>

<p>Hint systems in IF come in a variety of flavors: some are a static, prewritten set of guidelines (which might exist in a menu or outside the game entirely); others are built in as part of the program, and attempt to adapt to the situation the player currently faces. Adaptive hints have the advantage that they are less likely to reveal information for which the player is not ready, and the disadvantage that they are more work for the author.</p>
<p>The exercise here is to write an adaptive hint system that will both respond in agile ways to the state of the world model and require a minimum of authorial fussing. We also want the player to be able to ask for a hint about any object he encounters in the game world: this will let him be specific and avoid accidentally receiving hints about the wrong puzzles.</p>
<p>Our baseline assumption is that a player may find a puzzle unsolvable for one of two reasons: he either hasn't seen the relevant clue, or he hasn't got the relevant equipment. If these are true, then he should be given hints about how to find this information, and then once he has it, more specific hints about the puzzle itself -- ending, as a last resort, with the exact command(s) he will need to use in order to bring about the solution.</p>
<p>In practice, there are other possibilities, but this will do for an example.</p>
<p>We begin by defining our relations:</p>

<p>Now to the actual objects in the game:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3965_103" -->
<a id="c3965_103"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Crypt is a room. &quot;This squat, barrel-vaulted chamber runs roughly north-south. Along either side are the graves of Saxon kings and early bishops of the church long since gone to dust -- one [tomb] in particular looks undisturbed.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Notice that we used the bracketed tomb here: the tomb is scenery, and if we do not use the name-printing function, Inform will not register that we have mentioned it to the player.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3966_103" -->
<a id="c3966_103"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The tomb is scenery in the Crypt. The tomb is openable and closed. The silver dagger is a thing in the tomb. Understand &quot;tombs&quot; as the tomb. The description of the silver dagger is &quot;Gleaming in a soft light all its own. Its blade is figured with running deer and its hilt is made of horn.&quot; The wight requires the silver dagger.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we can add specific hints to replace the generic ones:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3968_103" -->
<a id="c3968_103"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The rest of the hint system ensures that the player will not see this final suggestion until he has the pry bar, since the tomb &quot;requires&quot; the pry bar. Having the hint there doesn't excuse us from providing some alternate wording in case the player solves this not-very-difficult conundrum on his own, though:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3969_103" -->
