<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.4. Looking</p>
<p>Looking is quite a complicated command, since the production of a room description takes many steps. A detailed description of this process may be found in the Room Descriptions section.</p>
<p>By convention, a player sees full descriptions of rooms he enters more than once, but may type BRIEF in order to see shorter descriptions, and SUPERBRIEF tells the story never to print room descriptions at all. VERBOSE restores the default behavior.</p>
<p>These conventions are not always appropriate, however, especially in works where experiencing a changing environment is essential. The use option</p>

<a id="c11422"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>changes the default behavior so that rooms are not always described fully to the player. <span class="boldface">Verbosity</span> demonstrates how this works.</p>
<p>The player always has the option of turning room descriptions to BRIEF or SUPERBRIEF mode. <span class="boldface">Verbosity 2</span> demonstrates how we might remove the player's ability to change the default behavior.</p>

<p>By default, the description of a room is printed every time the player enters a room.</p>
<p>On a device with very limited screen space, however, we might wish to supplant that behavior with &quot;brief&quot; descriptions. In Brief mode, Inform prints room descriptions only when the player enters that room for the first time. Afterwards, the text is skipped, for brevity, though the player can see it again at any time by typing LOOK.</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous chapter, we can set &quot;use options&quot; to control certain aspects of the player's experience. One of the use options is the option to</p>

<p>If we type &quot;test me&quot; during play, these commands will be carried out automatically, and we can see that when we return to the Research Wing, the description is not given a second time.</p>
<p>Some notes: the player can also turn full-length descriptions on or off with the commands &quot;verbose&quot; and &quot;brief&quot;, or set a minimal-description setting with the command &quot;superbrief&quot;.

<p>Suppose that we want the player always to see full room descriptions, even if he tries to reset the defaults -- perhaps because there is vital information there which he will miss if he turns off full-length room descriptions.</p>
<p>To do this, we might want to remove the standard behavior of the three actions associated with BRIEF, SUPERBRIEF, and VERBOSE, replacing them with explanatory messages about how the game behaves. We cannot use Instead to override these actions, because Instead rules do not apply to actions out of world. Instead, we will want to remove and replace the carry out rules.</p>
<p>We can do this easily by going to the Actions Index, looking up the detail panel for, say, &quot;preferring abbreviated room descriptions&quot;, and click the &quot;unlist&quot; button to paste in the sentence that will remove this rule from the rulebook.</p>
<p>Let's remove all three of the carry out rules and substitute our own:</p>
