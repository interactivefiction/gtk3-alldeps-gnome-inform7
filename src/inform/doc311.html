<p class="sectionheading">ยง18.25. Listing nondescript items of something</p>
<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> This activity prints up the also-ran paragraph at the end of a room description. These are nondescript items because they don't merit paragraphs of their own: if, as sometimes happens, there are none in the room, then no such paragraph is printed and this activity does not happen. (So to add a further paragraph to a room description, a simpler &quot;after looking&quot; rule should be used, not an &quot;after listing nondescript items&quot; rule.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> The paragraph ordinarily reads as &quot;You can also see a cask and a clock.&quot; or similar. Before the activity begins, those objects which are nondescript - in this case the cask and the clock - are given the property of being &quot;marked for listing&quot;.</p>
<p>If it turns out that nothing is marked for listing, because of before rules like the one in the example below, then nothing is printed and <span class="boldface">the activity is abandoned</span>, so that the rules for and after are never reached.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) Promoting something out of the nondescript category, by unmarking it.</p>

<p>As we've already seen, that's no problem if Rip is scenery. He'll stay there motionless.</p>
<p>But what if something in the game allows Rip to wake up? Or what if we want to use the same technique on a portable object that the player should be allowed to take? Clearly in that case it's not appropriate to make the mentioned thing be scenery, and at the same time, we need to keep Inform from adding a superfluous</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We start by defining relations that let us know where items &quot;belong&quot;, with the understanding that if something is where it belongs, it will be described in the main room description and therefore should not be separately listed. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6793_453" -->

Room-positioning relates various things to various rooms. The verb to be room-placed in means the room-positioning relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can't make relations relate various objects to various objects, and rooms are not things, so two separate cases are necessary. An alternative approach would be to say &quot;A thing has an object called the initial placement&quot;, which would allow a thing to have an initial placement that was a room, a supporter, or a container; an advantage of using relations, though, is that that way we can if we like specify multiple placements for the same object, so that, e.g., a sparkling diamond can be described in the main description paragraph as &quot;half-buried in dust&quot; in the beginning of the game, and then at the end as &quot;in the eye of the idol&quot; at the end.</p>
<p>Now we define, based on these relations, an &quot;in-place&quot; adjective, which will identify whether something is in a location which will specially describe it:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6795_453" -->
<a id="c6795_453"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a thing (called prop) is in-place:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the prop is in the location and the prop is room-placed in the location, yes;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the holder of the prop is a thing and the prop is placed in the holder of the prop, yes;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;no.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c6796_453" -->
<a id="c6796_453"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a thing is out-of-place if it is not in-place.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>With that done, removing these items automatically from the room description is actually pretty easy:</p>

<p>One tricky case remains: when something is placed on a supporter that is scenery, it can be mentioned even if we have marked that object &quot;not marked for listing&quot;. What matters here is not whether the object itself is marked for listing but whether the supporter has been &quot;mentioned&quot;.
