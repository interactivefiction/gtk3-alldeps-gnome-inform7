<p class="sectionheading">ยง16.13. Topic columns</p>
<p>When double-quoted matter appears in a column of a table, Inform will normally treat that as text for printing out. The exception is when the column is called &quot;topic&quot;, where it is treated as text for comparing against what the player has typed. There is really only one operation allowed with topic columns, the &quot;...listed in...&quot; construction, but fortunately it is the one most often needed.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that the Sybil has a penchant for telling passers-by which is the Greek muse for what. We might write:</p>

<p>We have so far seen several ways to write conversational characters in Inform, and we will see more before the end of the manual. This naturally raises the question, which should we use? To which the answer is: it depends on the sort of game we're writing, and what we want our characters to do. The more rich and complex the system, the more likely that it will require a lot of content; if we add question types as well as keywords, for instance, we instantly multiply the number of responses we have to write by five or six. It is not worth doing this unless there is some corresponding advantage within the game.</p>

<p>And now we have a game that will accept (though not always respond very sensibly to) questions of almost any form we might put to another character: ASK SOLOMON WHAT RAIN IS will be answered, but then again, it won't be distinguished from, say, ASK SOLOMON WHETHER THIS PERSISTENT RAIN IS A DIVINE PUNISHMENT OR WHAT.</p>
<p>All the same, a system that allowed the player a bit more specification of questions than simple keyword-use might be useful in a mystery game, for instance, where we might want to let our detective conduct inquiries into specific details. An alternative approach to the rather free one above would be to force the player to use only questions of the form WHAT IS RAIN? or WHO ARE YOU?: this would cut down on false-positive matches. But we might still choose to store the responses in a table of this type.</p>
