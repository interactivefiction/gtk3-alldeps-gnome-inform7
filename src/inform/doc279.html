<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.15. Understanding things by their properties</p>
<p>Items are ordinarily understood only by their original given names. For instance, if we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5897" -->
<a id="c5897"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Herb Garden is a china pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the player could refer to this as &quot;pot&quot;, &quot;china pot&quot; or &quot;china&quot;. We can embellish this by adding extra forms:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5898" -->
<a id="c5898"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;chinese pot&quot; or &quot;chinese vase&quot; as the china pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But suppose the pot changes its nature in the course of play? If we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5899" -->
<a id="c5899"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The china pot can be unbroken or broken. The china pot is unbroken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c5900" -->
<a id="c5900"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After dropping the china pot:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the china pot is broken;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed name of the pot is &quot;broken pot&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So now the player would reasonably expect to call it &quot;broken pot&quot;, a wording which would have been rejected before. We can achieve this by writing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5901" -->
<a id="c5901"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the unbroken property as describing the pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which allows &quot;unbroken&quot; or &quot;broken&quot; to describe the pot, depending on its state. And, since the player might well use a different adjective but with the same idea in mind, we can even add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5902" -->
<a id="c5902"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;shattered&quot; or &quot;cracked&quot; or &quot;smashed&quot; as broken. Understand &quot;pristine&quot; as unbroken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is something of a toy example, but the feature looks rather more useful when there are more pots than just one:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5903" -->
<a id="c5903"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<!-- END CODE -->

<a id="c5904"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c5905" -->
<a id="c5905"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpot&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed plural name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpots&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c5906" -->
<a id="c5906"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden are ten unbroken flowerpots.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We then have the dialogue:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5907" -->
<a id="c5907"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Herb Garden
<br />You can see ten flowerpots here.
<br />&gt;get two flowerpots
<br />flowerpot: Taken.
<br />flowerpot: Taken.
<br />&gt;drop all
<br />flowerpot: Crack!
<br />flowerpot: Crack!
<br />&gt;look
<br />Herb Garden
<br />You can see two broken flowerpots and eight flowerpots here.
<br />&gt;get an unbroken flowerpot
<br />Taken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>There are in fact two slightly different forms of this kind of sentence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5908" -->
<a id="c5908"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
<br />Understand the broken property as referring to a flowerpot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The only difference is that in the &quot;describing&quot; case, the property's name alone can mean the thing in question - so &quot;take unbroken&quot; will work; whereas, in the &quot;referring to&quot;, the property's name can only be used as an adjective preceding the name of thing itself - so &quot;take unbroken flowerpot&quot; will work but &quot;take unbroken&quot; will not.</p>

<p>where no television is specified. When we are designing commands which involve two elements (here, a television and a channel number), it's usually a good idea to allow the player to specify those elements in either order, as we saw demonstrated briefly in &quot;New commands for old grammar&quot;.</p>
<p>We might, therefore, want to add a few refinements: first by defining a &quot;[channel]&quot; token that will accept input of the forms &quot;[number]&quot; and &quot;channel [number]&quot;, and second by creating some additional &quot;Understand&quot; lines that will accept variant versions of the player's input.</p>
