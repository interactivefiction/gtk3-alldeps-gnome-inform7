<p>
The application ran your source text through the Inform 7 compiler, as usual, and it found no problems translating the source as far as a sort of intermediate-level code - a program for Inform 6, which would ordinarily then be used to make the final working IF.<p>Unfortunately, the program must have been too demanding for Inform 6 to handle, because it reported that one of its memory settings had been broken. These are upper limits, usually on the number of things of a particular sort which can be created, or on the amount of memory available for a given purpose.<p>To get around this, look at the actual output produced by Inform 6 to see which memory setting was broken. For instance, suppose it said:<p><blockquote>The memory setting MAX_PROP_TABLE_SIZE (which is 30000 at present) has been exceeded.</blockquote><p>You then need to amend your Inform 7 source text to take account of this, by adding a sentence like the following:<p><blockquote>Use MAX_PROP_TABLE_SIZE of 50000.</blockquote><p>With sentences like this, you can make Inform 6 raise its limits until there's no longer any problem: see Chapter 2 of the documentation.
