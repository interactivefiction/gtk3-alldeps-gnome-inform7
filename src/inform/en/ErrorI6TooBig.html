<p>
The application ran your source text through the Inform 7 compiler, as usual, and it found no problems translating the source. This process results in what's called a <font color="#000080"><b>story file</b></font>, which is a program for a small virtual computer. Unfortunately, the story file for this source text was too big for that virtual machine: there's just too much of it.<p>Inform can produce story files for several different virtual computers, and the one used by the current project can be selected using the Settings panel. If you are currently using the <font color="#000080"><b>Z-machine</b></font> format, try switching the project to <font color="#000080"><b>Glulx</b></font> format (you can make this change at the Settings panel), and limits like this will probably not bother you again. Although Z-machine story files used to be much more widely playable than Glulx ones, these days Glulx interpreters are widely available, so it's probably not worth making big sacrifices to stay within the Z-machine memory size.
