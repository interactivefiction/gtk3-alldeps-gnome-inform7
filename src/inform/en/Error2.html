<p>
The application ran your source text through the Inform 7 compiler, as usual, but the compiler unexpectedly failed. This should not happen even if your source text is gibberish, so you may have uncovered a bug in the program.<p>When a program like the I7 compiler fails, it typically returns an error number: this time, the number was 2, so I7 probably stopped because of a fatal file-system error.<p>It is very unlikely that your computer is at fault. More likely causes are:<p><UL TYPE=SQUARE><LI>disc space running out on the volume holding the project;</LI><LI>trying to run a project from a read-only volume, such as a burned CD or DVD;</LI><LI>trying to run a project which belongs to another user, whose files you have no permission to alter.</UL></LI></UL><p>However, if you think it more likely that the Inform 7 compiler is at fault, please check that you have the currently distributed build of the system: if you have, please consider taking the time to fill out a bug report at the Inform bug tracker (www.inform7.com/bugs).
