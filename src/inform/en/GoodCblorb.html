<p>
The source text was successfully translated to produce the story file, and the &quot;cblorb&quot; packaging tool was then used to wrap it up into a Blorb archive, the standard run-time format produced by Inform.<p><center><img src='inform:/cblorb_succeeded.png' border=0></center><p>In the same way that books in many different languages nevertheless have the same kind of binding, the Blorb wrapper can contain story files of several different story file formats (for instance, versions of Glulx or the Z-machine): see Chapter 2 of the Inform documentation.<p>Many modern interpreters can play Blorbed story files, but a few older ones cannot; besides, you might need a raw story file for use on a small portable device with very little memory. If you do need to avoid Blorbing, go to the Settings panel for the project and untick the &quot;Create a Blorb archive for release&quot; box, then release again. The result will be just a bare story file, and none of the advanced release options (solutions, website, cover art, etc.) will be possible. The bibliographic data will also be lost.
