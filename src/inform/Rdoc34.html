<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.6. Looking Under and Hiding</p>
<p>Finding hidden objects is a classic puzzle in IF. <span class="boldface">Beachfront</span> provides the most basic example, an object that becomes visible only when we have searched the papers on a cluttered desk. <span class="boldface">Beneath the Surface</span> takes this further, giving all large furnishings the ability to conceal items, and allowing the player to put things underneath other things, as well as find them. <span class="boldface">Flashlight</span> adds an extra twist to the puzzle by requiring that the player have a flashlight to shine under a bulky object in order to find what lies underneath.</p>
<p>Looking inside an object is generally handled by the searching action, and we could extend that to allow the player to search multiple or complex objects. <span class="boldface">Matreshka</span> turns the puzzle on its head by allowing the player to search a whole room systematically with only a single command.</p>

<p>Suppose we have our player, a detective, searching for evidence; we don't want him to be able to use this evidence until he has performed the action that reveals it, but after that it should be visible in the room when he looks.</p>
<p>A simple way to do this is to start the object -- an envelope, in this scenario -- out of play, and only move it into the location when the player looks for it:</p>
