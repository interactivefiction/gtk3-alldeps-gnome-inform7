<p>Stretching a point seasonally, we might write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7383" -->
<a id="c7383"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This rule is nameless. It needs no name because it will never need to be referred to: by identifying it as an every turn rule we have already said enough to lodge it in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook. In fact, though, it is easy to create a named rule:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7384" -->
<a id="c7384"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
This is the blossom shaking rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The name of a rule must always end with the word &quot;rule&quot;, for clarity's sake. (The phrasing &quot;This is the ... rule&quot; is used because &quot;The ... rule&quot; would be open to misinterpretation.)</p>
<p>Previously we had a rule which had no name, but belonged to a rulebook: now we have the opposite, because although the &quot;blossom shaking rule&quot; has a name, it has not been placed in any rulebook. That means it will probably never be applied, unless we give specific instructions for that.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to both name and place a rule in a single sentence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7385" -->
<a id="c7385"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn (this is the alternative blossom rule): say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now the &quot;alternative blossom rule&quot; is a named rule in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook.</p>

<p>A thing can have a rule as a property, if we like. Here we are going to allow the player to make a soup whose effects will depend on its ingredients. Each ingredient will have its own &quot;food effect&quot; rule, to be followed when the food is eaten.</p>
<p>Note that there are other, slightly less cumbersome ways to do the same thing -- we will see in the chapter on Rulebooks that we could make a &quot;food effects rulebook&quot; and then write a number of rules such as &quot;food effects rule for carrots&quot; or &quot;food effects rule for the stone&quot;. Nonetheless, we demonstrate rules-as-properties here for the sake of thoroughness.</p>
<p>So:</p>
