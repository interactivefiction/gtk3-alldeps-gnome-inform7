<p class="sectionheading">ยง3.7. Lighting</p>
<p>At any place (room, or inside a container) light is either fully present or fully absent. Inform does not usually try to track intermediate states of lighting, but see <span class="boldface">The Undertomb 2</span> for a single lantern with varying light levels and <span class="boldface">Zorn of Zorna</span> for multiple candles that can be lit for cumulative changes to the light level.</p>
<p>Light can be added to, but not taken away: rooms and things can act as sources of light, by having the &quot;lighted&quot; and &quot;lit&quot; properties respectively, but they cannot be sinks which drain light away. The reason darkness is not a constant hazard in Inform-written games is that rooms always have the &quot;lighted&quot; property unless declared &quot;dark&quot;. (We assume daylight or some always-on electric lighting.) A &quot;dark&quot; room may well still be illuminated if a light source happens to be present:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10330" -->
<a id="c10330"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Deep Crypt is a dark room. The candle lantern is a lit thing in the Deep Crypt.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p><span class="boldface">Hymenaeus</span> allows us to explicitly refer to torches as &quot;lit&quot; or &quot;unlit&quot;, or (as synonyms) &quot;flaming&quot; or &quot;extinguished&quot;.</p>
<p>For light produced electrically we might want a wall switch, as in <span class="boldface">Down Below</span>, or a portable lamp, as in <span class="boldface">The Dark Ages Revisited</span>.</p>
<p>The fierce, locally confined light thrown out by a carried lamp has a quality quite unlike weak but ambient daylight, and <span class="boldface">Reflections</span> exploits this to make a lantern feel more realistic.</p>
<p>When the player experiences darkness in a location, Inform is usually very guarded in what it reveals. (&quot;It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.&quot;) <span class="boldface">Hohmann Transfer</span> gives darkness a quite different look, and <span class="boldface">Four Stars</span> heightens the other senses so that a player in darkness can still detect her surroundings. The first of the two examples in <span class="boldface">Peeled</span> allows exploration of a dark place by touch.</p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to check whether a room that is not the current location happens to contain a light source or be naturally lighted. This poses a few challenges. <span class="boldface">Unblinking</span> demonstrates one way of doing this, so long as there are no backdrop light sources.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Cloak of Darkness</span> is a short and sweet game based on a light puzzle.</p>

<p>Suppose we're simulating a situation where the player needs to travel through lit areas only, but we want to give him some hints about which way might be safe. Here we'll find our best route through light-filled rooms.</p>
<p>The slightly tricky part is that it's not necessarily easy to tell whether a room has a lamp in it. We may say &quot;if the Crypt is lighted&quot;, but that only tells us whether it has been declared to be inherently lighted or dark, not whether it happens to contain a light source that the player would be able to see if he went in.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get around this is to create an object -- the light-meter; place it in the target location; and check whether it &quot;can see&quot; a lit object. This preserves all the usual rules about open and closed containers, transparency, etc.</p>

<p>An important word of caution: this method would give false negatives if there were a backdrop lightsource, such as the moon, providing light to the Upward Path. This is because backdrops are actually moved around the map by Inform during play, following the player around. So if the moon backdrop is in the Crash Site with the player, it will not be in the Upward Path as well -- even if it's scheduled to move there as soon as the player does.</p>

<p>&quot;Cloak of Darkness&quot; is a brief example game that has been implemented in nearly every IF system currently used. It hasn't got much claim to complexity or richness, but it does exemplify many of the standard things one might want an IF language to be able to do: define descriptions and the results of actions, assign synonyms to nouns, create new verbs, handle darkness, track repeated acts, and so on.</p>

<p>We can add more rooms by specifying their relation to the first room. Unless we say otherwise, the connection will automatically be bidirectional, so &quot;The Cloakroom is west of the Foyer&quot; will also mean &quot;The Foyer is east of the Cloakroom&quot;:</p>

<p>We could if we wished use a number to indicate how many times the player has stepped on the message, but Inform also makes it easy to add descriptive properties of this sort, so that the code remains readable even when the reader does not know what &quot;the number of the message&quot; might mean.</p>
