<p class="sectionheading">ยง3.7. Properties depend on kind</p>
<p>Properties depend very much on kind. It makes no sense to ask whether a room is transparent or opaque, for instance, so Inform will not allow this either to be specified or queried.</p>
<p>Another way that kind influences properties can be seen from an earlier example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c207" -->
<a id="c207"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Gazebo is a room. A billiards table is in the Gazebo. On it is a trophy cup. A starting pistol is in the cup.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The cup, the pistol and the table are all allowed to have the &quot;fixed in place&quot; property, but in fact only the table actually has it: the cup and the pistol are created as &quot;portable&quot; instead. This is because Inform knows that most things are portable, but that supporters - such as the table - are usually fixed in place. If this assumption is wrong, we need only add the line:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c208" -->
<a id="c208"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The table is portable.
