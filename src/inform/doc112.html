<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.15. Kinds of action</p>
<p>Especially when people need to react to events going on around them, it is helpful to be able to categorise actions into whole areas of behaviour. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1585" -->
<a id="c1585"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Kissing Mr Carr is unmaidenly behaviour.
<br />Doing something to the painting is unmaidenly behaviour.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1586" -->
<a id="c1586"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of unmaidenly behaviour in the Inn, say &quot;How unmaidenly!&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here a new kind of action called &quot;unmaidenly behaviour&quot; has been created and then used in the description of an instead rule. The convenience of this approach is that when further actions suddenly occur to us as also being unmaidenly - say, attacking Mr Carr - we only need to add a single line:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1587" -->
<a id="c1587"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Attacking Mr Carr is unmaidenly behaviour.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And this will automatically be reflected in any rules which concern the consequences of failing to be ladylike.</p>
<p>(Note that we were only allowed to say that &quot;Kissing Mr Carr is unmaidenly behaviour.&quot; because Inform already knew from earlier sentences - see the example below - that Mr Carr was a person, and therefore that &quot;kissing Mr Carr&quot; made sense as a description of an action.)</p>
