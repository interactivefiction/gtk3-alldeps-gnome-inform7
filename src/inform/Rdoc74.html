<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.7. Painting and Labeling Devices</p>
<p>Writing on something is only one way a player can change its visual appearance. IF authors have long been wary of paint brushes, because a sufficiently motivated player could go through a whole landscape like a graffiti artist with a railway bridge. We want to give the player the illusion of freedom of action, while avoiding a situation where unlimited numbers of different decorations might be needed - that would need a table of potentially unlimited size.</p>
<p>One approach is to limit the number of items which can be decorated. In <span class="boldface">Palette</span>, only the canvas can be painted, and each image overlays the last. <span class="boldface">Early Childhood</span> increases the range to allow a whole kind (&quot;block&quot;) to be painted, and also shows how the changing colours can be used to distinguish between otherwise identical objects.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Brown</span> finds a different way to limit the number of simultaneous decorations: almost anything can have a red sticky label attached, but there is only one red sticky label. (So to decorate a new item, the player must first un-decorate an old one.)</p>

<p>Which is fine, so far as it goes, but the colour property is not at all visible to the player, who simply sees &quot;eleven blocks&quot;. We thought of colour as being something outwardly apparent, but Inform does not know this. To achieve a better effect, we will need features from distant chapters. The first is an activity called &quot;printing the name of&quot;:</p>

<p>This too, however, is unsatisfactory. The individual blocks are correctly described, but we are unable to distinguish them during play: we cannot type &quot;take a green block&quot;, for instance. And because the blocks are indistinguishable in play, they are still massed together as &quot;eleven blocks&quot; in room descriptions. We need to go one step further:</p>
