<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.15. All, each and every</p>
<p>When testing conditions, we normally talk only about specific things, or else ask if a particular circumstance happens:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1201" -->
<a id="c1201"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the oaken door is open
<br />if a woman is carrying an animal
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But we can also use &quot;all&quot;, &quot;each&quot; or &quot;every&quot; to check the whole range:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1202" -->
<a id="c1202"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if each door is open
<br />if anyone is carrying all of the animals
<br />if everybody is in the Dining Room
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform allows other English &quot;determiners&quot; (as they are sometimes called), as well:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1203" -->
<a id="c1203"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if some of the doors are open
<br />if most of the doors are open
<br />if almost all of the doors are open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are true if at least one case is true, if a majority (any number greater than one half) or at least 80 per cent of the possible cases are true, respectively.</p>
<p>And we can also use &quot;none&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. These three are all ways to say the same thing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1204" -->
<a id="c1204"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if no door is open
<br />if all of the doors are not open
<br />if none of the doors is open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>though it may be clearer style to find a positive way of putting things:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1205" -->
<a id="c1205"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if all of the doors are closed
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>All, each and every can be applied to values, too - but only in some cases. For example, suppose we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1206" -->
<a id="c1206"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. A colour can be found or unfound.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And suppose that, during play, we assign the &quot;found&quot; property to any colour which the player notices on a wall. We might then want to write conditions like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1207" -->
<a id="c1207"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if every colour is found
<br />if most of the colours are found
<br />if any colour is found
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But we always have to bear in mind that Inform might have no reasonable way to decide these questions. It will refuse to allow these, for example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1208" -->
<a id="c1208"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if every number is positive
<br />if any text is palindromic
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(even supposing the adjective &quot;palindromic&quot; has been defined) - there are practically infinitely many possible numbers and texts, so the search cannot sensibly be done.</p>

<p>This example does include a number of features that we haven't met yet, particularly rulebooks. Nonetheless, the basic idea should be relatively clear. Our premise is that the player is faced with a series of disgruntled furnishings, none of which want to be responsible for supporting the cold, hot, drippy, or spiky objects lying around the room.</p>
