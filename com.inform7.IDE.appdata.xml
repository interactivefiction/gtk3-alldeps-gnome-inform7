    <p>
      Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interactive fiction is a literary form which involves programming a
      computer so that it presents a reader with a text which can be explored.
      Inform aims to make the burden of learning to program such texts as light
      as possible.
